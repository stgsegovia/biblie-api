{"verse":"15","text":"Moses killed the bull and took some of the blood. He used his finger to put the blood on all four horns of the altar to dedicate it and purify it. He poured out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar, and consecrated the altar so that it could be used to make people right."}

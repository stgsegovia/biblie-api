{"verse":"23","text":"but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which donâ€™t see, hear, or know; and you have not glorified the God in whose hand is your breath and whose are all your ways."}

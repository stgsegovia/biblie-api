{"verse":"19","text":"They marvelled at her beauty, and marvelled at the children of Israel because of her. Each one said to his neighbour, â€œWho would despise these people, who have amongst them such women? For it is not good that one man of them be left, seeing that, if they are let go, they will be able to deceive the whole earth."}

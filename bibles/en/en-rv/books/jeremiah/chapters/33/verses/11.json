{"verse":"11","text":"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that bring sacrifices of thanksgiving into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith the LORD."}

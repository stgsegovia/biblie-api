{"verse":"3","text":"And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever."}

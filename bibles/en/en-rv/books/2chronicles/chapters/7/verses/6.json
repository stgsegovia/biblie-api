{"verse":"6","text":"And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to give thanks unto the LORD, for his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood."}

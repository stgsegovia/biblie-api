{"verse":"10","text":"And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the oblations into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store."}

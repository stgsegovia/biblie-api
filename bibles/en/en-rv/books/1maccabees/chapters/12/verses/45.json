{"verse":"45","text":"And now send them away to their homes, but choose for thyself a few men who shall be with thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it up to thee, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the kingâ€™s officers: and I will return and depart; for this is the cause of my coming."}

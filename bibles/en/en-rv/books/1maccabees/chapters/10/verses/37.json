{"verse":"37","text":"And of them some shall be placed in the kingâ€™s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and let those that are over them, and their rulers, be of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judah."}

{"verse":"34","text":"We have confirmed therefore unto them the borders of Judaea, and also the three governments of Aphaerema and Lydda and Ramathaim (these  were added unto Judaea from the country of Samaria), and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the kingâ€™s dues which the king received of them yearly aforetime from the produce of the earth and the fruits of trees."}

{"verse":"14","text":"And it came to pass, when they were gone forth, the king set the meat before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and they strewed all the temple with them  in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the kingâ€™s signet, and so departed."}

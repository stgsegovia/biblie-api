{"verse":"14","text":"And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest I go in and die, even as those before me: for a Gr. demon, and so in ver. 15, 17.  devil loveth her, which hurteth no man, but those which come unto her: and now I fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life to the grave with sorrow because of me: and they have no other son to bury them."}

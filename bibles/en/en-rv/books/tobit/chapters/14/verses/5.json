{"verse":"5","text":"and God shall again have mercy on them, and bring them back into the land, and they shall build the house, but not like to the former house,  until the times of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from the places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem with honour, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, even as the prophets spake concerning it."}

{"verse":"17","text":"And Tobit gave thanks before them, because God had shewed mercy on him. And when Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Welcome, daughter: blessed is God which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed are  thy father and thy mother. And there was joy to all his brethren which were at Nineveh."}

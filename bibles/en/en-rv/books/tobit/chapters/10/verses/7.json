{"verse":"7","text":"And she said unto him, Hold thy peace, deceive me not; my child hath perished. And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and did eat no bread in the day-time, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there."}

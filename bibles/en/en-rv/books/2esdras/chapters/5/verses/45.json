{"verse":"45","text":"And I said, How hast thou said unto thy servant, that So the Syriac.  thou wilt surely make alive at once the creature that thou hast created? The Latin omits If...alive at once.  If therefore they shall be alive at once, and the creature shall sustain them: even so it might now also support them to be present at once."}

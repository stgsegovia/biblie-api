{"verse":"48","text":"For an evil heart hath grown up in us, which hath led us astray from these statutes,  and hath brought us into corruption and into the ways of death, hath shewed us the paths of perdition and removed us far from life; and that, not a few only, but well nigh all that have been created."}

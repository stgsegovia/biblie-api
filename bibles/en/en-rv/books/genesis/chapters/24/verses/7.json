{"verse":"7","text":"The LORD, the God of heaven, that took me from my fatherâ€™s house, and from the land of my nativity, and that spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."}

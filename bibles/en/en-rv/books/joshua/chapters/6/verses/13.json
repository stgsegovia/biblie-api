{"verse":"13","text":"And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of ramsâ€™ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets; and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests blowing with the trumpets as they went."}

{"verse":"51","text":"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land."}

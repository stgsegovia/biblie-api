{"verse":"32","text":"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still: now therefore let me see the kingâ€™s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me."}

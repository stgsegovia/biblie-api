{"verse":"26","text":"But Alcimus, perceiving the good will that was betwixt them, Or, and the covenants that had been made, took occasion and came  and having got possession of the covenants that had been made, came unto Demetrius and told him that Nicanor was ill affected toward the state, for he had appointed that conspirator against his kingdom, Judas, to be his successor."}

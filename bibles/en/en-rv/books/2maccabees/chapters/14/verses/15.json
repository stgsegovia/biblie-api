{"verse":"15","text":"But when the Jews  heard of Nicanorâ€™s inroad and the assault of the heathen, they sprinkled earth upon their heads  and made solemn supplication to him who had established his own people for evermore, and who alway, making manifest his presence, upholdeth them that are  his own portion."}

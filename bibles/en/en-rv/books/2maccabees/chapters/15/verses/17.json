{"verse":"17","text":"And being encouraged by the words of Judas, which were of a lofty strain, and able to incite unto virtue and to stir the souls of the young unto manly courage, they determined Or, not to go out to battle, but nobly to engage within their lines, &c. The Greek text of this passage is uncertain.  not to carry on a campaign, but nobly to bear down upon the enemy,  and fighting hand to hand with all courage bring the matter to an issue, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger."}

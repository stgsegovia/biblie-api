{"verse":"36","text":"For these our brethren, having endured a Gr. short pain of ever-flowing life.  short pain that bringeth everlasting life, have now Gr. fallen. By the omission of one Greek letter the words would signify having endured a short pain, have now drunk of ever-flowing life under God’s covenant.  died under God’s covenant; But thou, through the judgement of God, shalt receive in just measure the penalties of thine arrogancy."}

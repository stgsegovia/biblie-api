{"verse":"21","text":"But when Timotheus heard of the inroad of Judas, he at once sent away the women and the children and also the baggage into the fortress  called Compare Carnain, 1 Macc. 5. 26, 43, 44.  Carnion; for the place was hard to besiege and difficult of access by reason of the narrowness of the approaches on all sides."}

{"verse":"4","text":"And it was contained  in the writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should follow with him, Gr. and when. The Greek text here is probably corrupt.  when he went forth into the mountain where Moses went up and beheld the heritage of God."}

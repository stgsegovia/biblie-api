{"verse":"11","text":"And the people spoiled the camp for the space of thirty days: and they gave unto Judith Holofernesâ€™ tent, and all his silver cups, and his beds, and his vessels, and all his furniture: and she took them, and placed them on her mule, and made ready her wagons, and heaped them thereon."}

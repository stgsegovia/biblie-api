{"verse":"12","text":"And Nebuchadnezzar was exceeding wroth with all this land, and he sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely be avenged upon all the coasts of Cilicia and Damascus and Syria, that he would slay with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judaea, and all that were in Egypt, until thou comest to the borders of the two seas."}

{"verse":"17","text":"After three days, Paul called together those who were prominent among the Jews. When they had gathered together, he said to them, â€œBrothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."}

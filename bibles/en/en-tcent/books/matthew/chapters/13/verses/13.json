{"verse":"13","text":"That is why I speak to them in parables, 13:13-14 because ‘they see but do not perceive, and they hear but do not listen or understand.’ In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah ¦ so that ‘they may see but not perceive, and hear but not listen or understand, lest they should turn back.’ Then the prophecy of Isaiah will be fulfilled in them ANTbecause ‘they see but do not perceive, and they hear but do not listen or understand.’"}

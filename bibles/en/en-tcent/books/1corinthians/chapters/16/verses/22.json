Our 16:22 Lord has come ¦ Lord, come HF NA SBL ¦ {inconclusive} PCK [Note: The difference depends on where the word break occurs. The main Greek text reads Μαραν αθα (Maran atha) while HF, NA, and SBL read Μαρανα θα (Marana tha). PCK does not include a word break, leaving it ambiguous. However, in his English translation, Pickering prefers the reading of the main Greek text.]Lord has come!"}

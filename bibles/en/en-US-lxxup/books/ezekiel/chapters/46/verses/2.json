{"verse":"2","text":"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his whole burnt offerings and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate: then shall he come forth; but the gate shall not be shut till evening."}

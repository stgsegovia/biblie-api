{"verse":"1","text":"And these are the names of the tribes from the northern corner, on the side of the descent that draws a line to the entrance of Hamath the palace of Aelam, the border of Damascus northward on the side of Hamath the palace; and they shall have the eastern parts as far as the sea, for Dan, one portion."}

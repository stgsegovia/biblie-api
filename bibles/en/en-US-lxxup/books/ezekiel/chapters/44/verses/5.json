{"verse":"5","text":"And the Lord said to me, Son of man, attend with thy heart, and see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say to thee, according to all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the regulations thereof; and thou shalt attend well to the entrance of the house, according to all its outlets, in all the holy things."}

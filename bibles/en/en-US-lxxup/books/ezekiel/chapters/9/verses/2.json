{"verse":"2","text":"And, behold, six men came from the way of the high gate that looks toward the north, and each oneâ€™s axe was in his hand; and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet, and a sapphire girdle was on his loins: and they came in and stood near the brazen altar."}

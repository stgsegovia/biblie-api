{"verse":"7","text":"For any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and conceive his imaginations in his heart, and set before his face the punishment of his iniquity, and come to the prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him, according to the things wherein he is entangled."}

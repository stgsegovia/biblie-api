{"verse":"26","text":"Her priests also have set at nought my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them."}

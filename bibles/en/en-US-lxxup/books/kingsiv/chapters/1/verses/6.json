{"verse":"6","text":"And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou goest to inquire of Baal fly, the god of Ekron? it shall not be so: the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it, for thou shalt surely die."}

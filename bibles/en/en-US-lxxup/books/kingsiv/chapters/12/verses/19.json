{"verse":"19","text":"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things which Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, Ahaziah, his fathers, and kings of Judah had consecrated, and what he had himself dedicated, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the Lord’s house and the king’s house, and he sent them to Hazael king of Syria; and he went up from Jerusalem."}

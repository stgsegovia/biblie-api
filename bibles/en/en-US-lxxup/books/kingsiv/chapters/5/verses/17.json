{"verse":"17","text":"And Naaman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to thy servant, I pray thee, the load of a yoke of mules; and thou shalt give me of the red earth: for henceforth thy servant will not offer whole burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord by reason of this thing."}

{"verse":"26","text":"Whence comest thou, Gehazi? and Gehazi said, Thy servant has not been hither or thither. And Elisha said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man returned from his chariot to meet thee? and now thou hast received silver, and now thou hast received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants."}

{"verse":"18","text":"And let the Lord be propitious to thy servant when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Rimmon when he bows down in the house of Rimmon; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to thy servant in this matter."}

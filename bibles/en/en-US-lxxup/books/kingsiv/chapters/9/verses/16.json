{"verse":"16","text":"And Jehu rode and advanced, and came down to Jezreel; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezreel of the arrow wounds wherewith the Syrians had wounded him in Ramah in the war with Hazael king of Syria; for he was strong and a mighty man: and Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram."}

{"verse":"15","text":"And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and Jehu said to him, Is thy heart right with my heart, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Jehu said, If it is then, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot."}

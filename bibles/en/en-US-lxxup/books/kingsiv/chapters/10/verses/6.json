{"verse":"6","text":"And Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, If ye are for me, and hearken to my voice, take the heads of the men your masterâ€™s sons, and bring them to me at this time tomorrow in Jezreel. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up."}

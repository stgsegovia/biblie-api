{"verse":"27","text":"but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat offerings and our peace offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, Ye have no portion in the Lord."}

{"verse":"7","text":"And the borders continue on to the fourth part of the Valley of Achor, and go down to Gilgal, which is before the approach of Adummim, which is southward in the valley, and terminate at the water of the fountain of the sun; and their going forth shall be the fountain of Rogel."}

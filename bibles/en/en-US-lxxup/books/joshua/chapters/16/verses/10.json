{"verse":"10","text":"And Ephraim did not destroy the Canaanite who dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanite dwelt in Ephraim until this day, until Pharaoh the king of Egypt went up and took it, and burned it with fire; and the Canaanites, and Perizzites, and the dwellers in Gaza they destroyed, and Pharaoh gave them for a dowry to his daughter."}

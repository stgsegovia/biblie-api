{"verse":"33b","text":"but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshiped Astarte, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglon king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years."}

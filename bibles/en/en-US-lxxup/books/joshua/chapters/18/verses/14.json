{"verse":"14","text":"And the borders shall pass through and proceed to the part that looks toward the sea, on the south, from the mountain in front of Beth-horon southward, and its termination shall be at Kiriath-baal, this is Kiriath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah; this is the part toward the west."}

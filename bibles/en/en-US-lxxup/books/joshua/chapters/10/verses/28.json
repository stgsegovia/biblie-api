{"verse":"28","text":"And they took Makkedah on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makkedah, as they did to the king of Jericho."}

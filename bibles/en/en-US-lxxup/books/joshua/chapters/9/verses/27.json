{"verse":"27","text":"And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gibeon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose."}

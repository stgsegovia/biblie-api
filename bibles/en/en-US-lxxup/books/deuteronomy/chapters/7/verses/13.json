{"verse":"13","text":"And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the offspring of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, on the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers to give to thee."}

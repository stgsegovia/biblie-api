{"verse":"11","text":"And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy manservant and thy maidservant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which dwells among you, in whatsoever place the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name should be called there."}

{"verse":"14","text":"but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do in it no work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of thee; that thy manservant may rest, and thy maid, and thine ox, as well as thou."}

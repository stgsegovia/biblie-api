{"verse":"13","text":"And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have fully collected the holy things out of my house, and I have given them to the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, according to all the commands which thou didst command me: I did not transgress thy command, and I did not forget it."}

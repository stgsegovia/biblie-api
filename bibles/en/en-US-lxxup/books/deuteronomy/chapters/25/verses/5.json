{"verse":"5","text":"And if brethren should live together, and one of them should die, and should not have seed, the wife of the deceased shall not marry out of the family to a man not related: her husbandâ€™s brother shall go in to her, and shall take her to himself for a wife, and shall dwell with her."}

{"verse":"10","text":"even the things that happened in the day in which ye stood before the Lord our God in Horeb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons."}

{"verse":"59","text":"Therefore it is better to be a king that showeth his power, or else a profitable vessel in a house, which the owner shall have use of, than such false gods; or to be a door in a house, to keep such things safe as be therein, than such false gods; or a pillar of wood in a palace, than such false gods."}

{"verse":"1","text":"And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time of the going forth of kings to war, that Joab gathered the whole force of the army, and they ravaged the land of the children of Ammon; and he came and besieged Rabbah. But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah and destroyed it."}

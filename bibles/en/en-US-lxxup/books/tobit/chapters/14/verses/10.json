{"verse":"10","text":"And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineveh. Remember, my son, how Nadab handled Ahikar that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Ahikar was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasseh gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Nadab fell into the snare, and perished."}

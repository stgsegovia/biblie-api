{"verse":"17","text":"And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobitâ€™s eyes, and to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit: and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber."}

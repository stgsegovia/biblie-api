{"verse":"95","text":"And King Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they trusted in him; and they have changed the kingâ€™s word, and delivered their bodies to be burned, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."}

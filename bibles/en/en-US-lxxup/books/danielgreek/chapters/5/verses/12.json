{"verse":"12","text":"For there is an excellent spirit in him, and sense and understanding are in him, interpreting dreams as he does, and answering hard questions, and solving difficulties: it is Daniel, and the king gave him the name of Belteshazzar: now then let him be called, and he shall tell thee the interpretation of the writing."}

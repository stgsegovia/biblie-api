{"verse":"7","text":"To thee, O Lord, belongs righteousness, and to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever thou hast scattered them, for the sin which they committed."}

{"verse":"8","text":"All who preside over thy kingdom, captains and satraps, chiefs and local governors, have taken counsel together, to establish by a royal statute and to confirm a decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."}

{"verse":"4","text":"For with them we will tread them under foot, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith King Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words shall be in vain."}

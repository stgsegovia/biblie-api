{"verse":"5","text":"Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and slew them unto Choba: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies), and they that were in Gilead, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof."}

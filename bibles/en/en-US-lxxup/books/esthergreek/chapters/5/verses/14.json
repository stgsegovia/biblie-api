{"verse":"14","text":"And Zeresh his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a gallows made for thee of fifty cubits, and in the morning do thou speak to the king, and let Mordecai be hanged on the gallows: but do thou go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Haman, and the gallows was prepared."}

{"verse":"9","text":"Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah; and Damascus shall be left as a heap of the threshing floor, and desolate forever: and the remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them."}

{"verse":"5","text":"And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and Amorites, and Hivites, and Jebusites, and Girgashites, and Perizzites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt perform this service in this month."}

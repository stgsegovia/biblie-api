{"verse":"30","text":"and thou shalt put the two circlets on both the shoulders of the ephod in front. And thou shalt put the Manifestation and the Truth on the oracle of judgment; and it shall be on the breast of Aaron, when he goes into the holy place before the Lord; and Aaron shall bear the judgments of the children of Israel on his breast before the Lord continually."}

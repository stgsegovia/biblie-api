{"verse":"8","text":"And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, and to bring them into a good and wide land, into a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Girgashites, and Hivites, and Jebusites."}

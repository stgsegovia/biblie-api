{"verse":"3","text":"Behold, here am I, answer against me before the Lord and before his anointed: whose calf have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom of you have I oppressed? or whom have I been violent with? or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, even to a sandal? bear witness against me, and I will make restitution to you."}

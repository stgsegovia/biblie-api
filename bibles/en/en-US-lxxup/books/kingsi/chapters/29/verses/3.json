{"verse":"3","text":"And the lords of the Philistines said, Who are these that pass by? And Achish said to the captains of the Philistines, Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? he has been with us some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day."}

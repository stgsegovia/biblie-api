{"verse":"21","text":"And the Lord manifested himself again in Shiloh, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel; and Samuel was accredited to all Israel as a prophet to the Lord from one end of the land to the other: and Eli was very old, and his sons kept advancing in wickedness, and their way was evil before the Lord."}

{"verse":"28","text":"And I chose the house of thy father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priestâ€™s office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food."}

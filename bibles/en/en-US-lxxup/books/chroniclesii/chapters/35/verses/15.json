{"verse":"15","text":"And the sons of Asaph the psalm singers were at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun, the prophets of the king: also the chiefs and the porters of the several gatesâ€”it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them."}

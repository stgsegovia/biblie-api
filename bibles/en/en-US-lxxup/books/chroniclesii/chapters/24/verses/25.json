{"verse":"25","text":"And after they had departed from him, when they had left him in sore diseases, then his servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulcher of the kings."}

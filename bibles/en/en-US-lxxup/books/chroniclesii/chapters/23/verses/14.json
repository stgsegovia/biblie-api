{"verse":"14","text":"And Jehoiada the priest went forth, and Jehoiada the priest charged the captains of hundreds, even the captains of the host, and said to them, Thrust her forth outside the house, and follow her, and let her be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord."}

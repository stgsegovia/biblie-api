{"verse":"10","text":"And Azariah the priest, the chief over the house of Zadok, spoke to him, and said, From the time that the firstfruits began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten and drunk, and left even abundantly; for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount."}

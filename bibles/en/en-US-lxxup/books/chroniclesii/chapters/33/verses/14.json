{"verse":"14","text":"And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the Fish Gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Ophel; and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Judah."}

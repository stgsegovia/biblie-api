{"verse":"21","text":"Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for everyone that is left in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord which has been kindled amongst us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book."}

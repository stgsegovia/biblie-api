{"verse":"33","text":"then shalt thou hearken out of heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling place, and shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for; that all the nations of the earth may know thy name, and that they may fear thee, as thy people Israel do, and that they may know that thy name is called upon this house which I have built."}

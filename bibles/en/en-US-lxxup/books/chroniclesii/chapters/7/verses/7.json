{"verse":"7","text":"And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in the house of the Lord: for he offered there the whole burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, for the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not sufficient to receive the whole burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat."}

{"verse":"6","text":"And the priests were standing at their watches, and the Levites with instruments of music of the Lord, belonging to King David, to give thanks before the Lord, for his mercy endures forever, with the hymns of David, by their ministry: and the priests were blowing the trumpets before them, and all Israel standing."}

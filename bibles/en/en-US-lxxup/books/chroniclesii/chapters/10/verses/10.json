{"verse":"10","text":"And the young men that had been brought up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and do thou lighten somewhat of it from us; thus shalt thou say, My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins."}

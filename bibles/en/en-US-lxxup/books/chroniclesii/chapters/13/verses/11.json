{"verse":"11","text":"they sacrifice to the Lord whole burnt offering, morning and evening, and compound incense, and set the showbread on the pure table; and there is the golden candlestick, and the lamps for burning, to light in the evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord God of our fathers; but ye have forsaken him."}

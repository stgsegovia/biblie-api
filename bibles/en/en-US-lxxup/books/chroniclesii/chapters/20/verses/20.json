{"verse":"20","text":"And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and cried, and said, Hear me, Judah, and the dwellers in Jerusalem; put your trust in the Lord God, and your trust shall be honored; trust in his prophet, and ye shall prosper."}

{"verse":"9","text":"And there was there a prophet of the Lord, his name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that were coming to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers is upon Judah, and he has delivered them into your hands, and ye have slain them in wrath, and it has reached even to heaven."}

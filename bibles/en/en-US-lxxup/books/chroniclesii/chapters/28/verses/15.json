{"verse":"15","text":"And the men who were called by name rose up, and took hold of the prisoners, and clothed all the naked from the spoils, and gave them garments and shoes, and gave them food to eat, and oil to anoint themselves with, and they helped also everyone that was weak with asses, and placed them in Jericho, the city of palm trees, with their brethren; and they returned to Samaria."}

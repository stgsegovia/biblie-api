{"verse":"18","text":"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife; but, behold, the wild beasts of the field that are in Lebanon shall come: and the wild beasts did come, and trod down the thistle."}

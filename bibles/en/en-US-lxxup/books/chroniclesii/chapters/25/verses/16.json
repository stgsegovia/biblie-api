{"verse":"16","text":"And it came to pass when the prophet was speaking to him, that he said to him, Have I made thee kingâ€™s counselor? take heed lest thou be scourged: and the prophet forebore, and said, I know that God is disposed against thee to destroy thee, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not hearkened to my counsel."}

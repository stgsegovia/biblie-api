{"verse":"13","text":"And Gideon came, and behold a man was relating to his neighbor a dream, and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midian, and it came as far as a tent, and smote it, and it fell, and it turned it up, and the tent fell."}

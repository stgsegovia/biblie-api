{"verse":"19","text":"And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him powerfully, and he went down to Ashkelon, and destroyed of the inhabitants thirty men, and took their garments, and gave the changes of raiment to them that told the riddle; and Samson was very angry, and went up to the house of his father."}

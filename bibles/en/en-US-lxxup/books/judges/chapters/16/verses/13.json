{"verse":"13","text":"And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; tell me, I entreat thee, wherewith thou mayest be bound: and he said to her, If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web, and shouldest fasten them with the pin into the wall, then shall I be weak as another man."}

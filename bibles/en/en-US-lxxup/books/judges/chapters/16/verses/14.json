{"verse":"14","text":"And it came to pass when he was asleep, that Delilah took the seven locks of his head, and wove them with the web, and fastened them with the pin into the wall, and she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson: and he awoke out of his sleep, and carried away the pin of the web out of the wall."}

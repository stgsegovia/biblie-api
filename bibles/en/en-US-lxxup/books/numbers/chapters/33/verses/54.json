{"verse":"54","text":"And ye shall inherit their land according to your tribes; to the greater number ye shall give the larger possession, and to the smaller ye shall give the less possession; to whatsoever part a manâ€™s name shall go forth by lot, there shall be his property: ye shall inherit according to the tribes of your families."}

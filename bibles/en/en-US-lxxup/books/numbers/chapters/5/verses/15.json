{"verse":"15","text":"then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring his gift for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal: he shall not pour oil upon it, neither shall he put frankincense upon it; for it is a sacrifice of jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, recalling sin to remembrance."}

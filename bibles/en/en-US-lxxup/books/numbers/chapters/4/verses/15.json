{"verse":"15","text":"And Aaron and his sons shall finish covering the holy things, and all the holy vessels, when the camp begins to move; and afterward the sons of Kohath shall go in to take up the furniture; but shall not touch the holy things, lest they die: these shall the sons of Kohath bear in the tabernacle of witness."}

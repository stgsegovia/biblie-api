{"verse":"16","text":"Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is overseerâ€”the oil of the light, and the incense of composition, and the daily meat offering and the anointing oil, are his charge; even the oversight of the whole tabernacle, and all things that are in it in the holy place, in all the works."}

{"verse":"35","text":"And he shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the lamb of the sacrifice of peace offering is taken away, and the priest shall put it on the altar for a whole burnt offering to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he sinned, and it shall be forgiven him."}

{"verse":"20","text":"Whereas thou camest yesterday, shall I today cause thee to travel with us, and shalt thou thus change thy place? thou didst come forth yesterday, and today shall I set thee in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go whithersoever I may go: return then, and cause thy brethren to return with thee, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with thee."}

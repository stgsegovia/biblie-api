{"verse":"34","text":"but if thou shall return to the city, and shalt say to Absalom, Thy brethren are passed over, and the king thy father is passed over after me: and now I am thy servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of thy father, and now I am thy humble servantâ€”so shalt thou disconcert for me the counsel of Ahithophel."}

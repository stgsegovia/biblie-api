{"verse":"7","text":"forasmuch as thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee; and thou hast this day declared, that thy princes and thy servants are nothing in thy sight: for I know this day, that if Absalom were alive, and all of us dead today, then it would have been right in thy sight."}

{"verse":"32","text":"And Jonadab the son of Shimeah brother of David, answered and said, Let not my lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed to death by the mouth of Absalom from the day that he humbled his sister Tamar."}

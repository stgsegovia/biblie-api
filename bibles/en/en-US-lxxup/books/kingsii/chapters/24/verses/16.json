{"verse":"16","text":"And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough now, withhold thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."}

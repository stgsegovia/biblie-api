{"verse":"14","text":"And they buried the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and the bones of them that had been hanged, in the land of Benjamin in the hill, in the sepulcher of Kish his father; and they did all things that the king commanded: and after this God hearkened to the prayers of the land."}

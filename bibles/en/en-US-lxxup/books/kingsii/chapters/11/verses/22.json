{"verse":"22","text":"And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did ye draw nigh to the wall to fight? knew ye not that ye would be wounded from off the wall? Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thebez? why did ye draw near to the wall?"}

{"verse":"30","text":"And Absalom said to his servants, Behold, Joabâ€™s portion in the field is next to mine, and he has in it barley; go and set it on fire. And the servants of Absalom set the field on fire: and the servants of Joab come to him with their clothes rent, and they said to him, The servants of Absalom have set the field on fire."}

{"verse":"11","text":"the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of men saying, Give thanks to the Lord Almighty: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endures forever: and they shall bring gifts into the house of the Lord; for I will turn all the captivity of that land as before, said the Lord."}

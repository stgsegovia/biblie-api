{"verse":"5","text":"But if not, depart; return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Judah: to whatsoever places it seems good in thine eyes to go, do thou even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go."}

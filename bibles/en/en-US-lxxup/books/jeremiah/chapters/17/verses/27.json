{"verse":"27","text":"But it shall come to pass, if ye will not hearken to me to sanctify the Sabbath day, to bear no burdens, nor go in with them by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the streets of Jerusalem, and shall not be quenched."}

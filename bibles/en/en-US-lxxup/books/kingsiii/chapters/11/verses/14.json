{"verse":"14","text":"And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, and Rezon son of Eliada who dwelt in Raama, and Hadadezer king of Zobah his master (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damascus), and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Hadad the Edomite was of the seed royal in Edom."}

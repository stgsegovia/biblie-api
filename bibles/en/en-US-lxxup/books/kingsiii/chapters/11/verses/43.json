{"verse":"43","text":"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it, even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and dwelt in Egypt, he straightaway comes into his own city, into the land of Zeredah in the mount of Ephraim. And King Solomon slept with his fathers, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."}

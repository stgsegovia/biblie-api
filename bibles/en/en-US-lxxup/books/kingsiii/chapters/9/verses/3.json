{"verse":"3","text":"And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and thy supplication which thou madest before me: I have done for thee according to all thy prayer: I have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there forever, and mine eyes and my heart shall be there always."}

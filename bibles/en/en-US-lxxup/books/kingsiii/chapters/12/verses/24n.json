{"verse":"24n","text":"And the woman departed, when she heard this: and it came to pass as she entered into Zeredah, that the child died; and there came forth a wailing to meet her. And Jeroboam went to Shechem in Mount Ephraim, and assembled there the tribes of Israel; and Rehoboam the son of Solomon went up thither."}

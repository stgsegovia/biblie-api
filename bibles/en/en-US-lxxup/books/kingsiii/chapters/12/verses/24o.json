{"verse":"24o","text":"And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah son of Enlami, saying, Take to thyself a new garment which has not gone into the water, and rend it into twelve pieces; and thou shalt give some to Jeroboam, and shalt say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Take to thyself ten pieces to cover thee: and Jeroboam took them: and Shemaiah said, Thus saith the Lord concerning the ten tribes of Israel."}

{"verse":"24a","text":"So King Solomon sleeps with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead in Jerusalem, being sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twelve years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Naamah, daughter of Hanun son of Nahash king of the children of Ammon. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked not in the way of David his father."}

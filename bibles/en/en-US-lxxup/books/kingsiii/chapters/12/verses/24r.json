{"verse":"24r","text":"And Rehoboam rejected their counsel, and it pleased him not: and he sent and brought in those who had been brought up with him; and he said to them, Thus and thus has the people sent to me to say: and they that had been brought up with him said, Thus shalt thou speak to the people, saying, My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins; my father scourged you with whips, but I will rule you with scorpions."}

{"verse":"24b","text":"And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, a servant to Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam; and the name of his mother was Zeruah, a harlot; and Solomon made him head of the levies of the house of Joseph: and he built for Solomon Zeredah in Mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots of horses: he built the citadel with the levies of the house of Ephraim; he fortified the city of David, and aspired to the kingdom."}

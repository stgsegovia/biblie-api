{"verse":"15","text":"And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream: and he arose and came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Zion: and he offered whole burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants."}

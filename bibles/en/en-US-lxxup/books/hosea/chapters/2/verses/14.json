{"verse":"14","text":"And I will utterly destroy her vines, and her fig trees, all things of which she said, These are my hire which my lovers have given me: and I will make them a testimony, and the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them."}

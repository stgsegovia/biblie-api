{"verse":"4","text":"But I am the Lord thy God that establishes the heaven, and creates the earth, whose hands have framed the whole host of heaven: but I showed them not to thee that thou shouldest go after them: and I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me; and there is no Savior beside me."}

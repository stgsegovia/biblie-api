{"verse":"19","text":"And it came to pass, when the gates were set up in Jerusalem, before the Sabbath, that I spoke, and they shut the gates; and I gave orders that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burdens on the Sabbath day."}

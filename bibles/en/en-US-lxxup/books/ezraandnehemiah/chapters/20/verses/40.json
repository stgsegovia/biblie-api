{"verse":"40","text":"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring into the treasuries the firstfruits of the corn, and wine, and oil; and there are the holy vessels, and the priests, and the ministers, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God."}

{"verse":"11","text":"And all the people who were in the gate said, We are witnesses: and the elders said, The Lord make thy wife who goes into thy house, as Rachel and as Leah, who both together built the house of Israel, and wrought mightily in Ephrathah, and there shall be a name to thee in Bethlehem."}

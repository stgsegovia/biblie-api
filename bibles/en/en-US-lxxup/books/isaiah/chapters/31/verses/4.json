{"verse":"4","text":"For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lionâ€™s whelp over prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and the animals are awestruck and tremble at the fierceness of his wrath: so the Lord of hosts shall descend to fight upon the Mount Zion, even upon her mountains."}

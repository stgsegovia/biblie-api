{"verse":"4","text":"And they said to Pharaoh, We are come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flocks of thy servants, for the famine has prevailed in the land of Canaan; now then, we will dwell in the land of Goshen. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest that there are among them able men, make them overseers of my cattle. So Jacob and his sons came into Egypt, to Joseph; and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, heard of it."}

{"verse":"7","text":"The Lord the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me out of my fatherâ€™s house, and out of the land whence I sprang, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, I will give this land to thee and to thy seed, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife to my son from thence."}

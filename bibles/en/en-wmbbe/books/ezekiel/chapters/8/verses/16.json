{"verse":"16","text":"He brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house; and I saw at the door of the LORD’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs towards the LORD’s temple and their faces towards the east. They were worshipping the sun towards the east."}

{"verse":"10","text":"For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering: towards the north twenty-five thousand in length, and towards the west ten thousand in width, and towards the east ten thousand in width, and towards the south twenty-five thousand in length; and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the middle of it."}

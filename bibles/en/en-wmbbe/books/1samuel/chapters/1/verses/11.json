{"verse":"11","text":"She vowed a vow, and said, “LORD of Hosts, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”"}

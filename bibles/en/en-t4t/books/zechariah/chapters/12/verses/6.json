{"verse":"6","text":"At that time I will enable the leaders of Judah to be like [SIM] a pan containing hot coals that is put in a woodpile to set it on fire, or like [SIM] a burning torch that is put in a field of ripe grain to set it on fire. The leaders of Judah and their army will destroy the people of the surrounding nations in all directions. But the people of Jerusalem will remain safe."}

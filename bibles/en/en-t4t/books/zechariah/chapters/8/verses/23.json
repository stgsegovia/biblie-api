{"verse":"23","text":"The Commander of the armies of angels also says this: “At that time, this is what will happen everywhere: A group of people from one nation or a group of people who speak another language will grab the fringe/edge of the robe of a Jew and say to him, ‘We have heard people say that God is with you. So allow us to go with you to Jerusalem to worship him.’”"}

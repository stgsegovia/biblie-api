{"verse":"3","text":"So this is what I say: ‘Some day I will return to Zion Hill and I will live there. At that time, Jerusalem will be called the city where people ◄are faithful to/faithfully obey► me, and people will say that Zion  Hill is holy because it is where the Commander of the armies of angels dwells.’”"}

{"verse":"21","text":"Every pot in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah will be dedicated to the Commander of the armies of angels. So everyone who offers sacrifices there in Jerusalem will be able to take some of the meat that has been brought for sacrifices, and cook it in their own pots. And at that time, people will no longer buy or sell things in the courtyard of the temple of the Commander of the armies of angels."}

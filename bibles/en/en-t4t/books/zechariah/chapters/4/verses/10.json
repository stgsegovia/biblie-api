{"verse":"10","text":"No one [RHQ] should think that little things that are done at the beginning of a big project are unimportant. When the temple is almost finished being rebuilt, Zerubbabel will use a ◄plumb line/string with a stone fastened to it► to see if the walls they are building are straight; so when the people see that, they will rejoice.”"}

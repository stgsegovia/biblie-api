{"verse":"9","text":"He said to me, “Zerubbabel [SYN] laid the first stone in the foundation of the temple, and he will put the last stone in its place. When that happens, the people will know that it is I, the Commander of the armies of angels, who have sent you to them.” And he said, “The seven bowls represent the eyes of Yahweh, who looks back and forth at everything that happens on the earth.”"}

{"verse":"21","text":"At that time the Holy Spirit caused Jesus to be very happy. He said, “Father, you (sg) rule over everything in heaven and on the earth! Some people think that they are wise because they are well-educated. But I thank you that you have prevented them from knowing these things. Instead, you have revealed them to people who accept your truth as readily [MET] as little children do. Yes, Father, you have done that because it seemed good to you to do so.”"}

{"verse":"13","text":"“There will be terrible punishment for you people who live in [MTY] Chorazin and Bethsaida cities. I did great miracles in your cities to show God’s power, but you did not turn from your sinful behavior. If the miracles that I performed in your cities had been done in Tyre and Sidon cities, the wicked people who lived there would have long ago shown that they were sorry for their sins by sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their heads."}

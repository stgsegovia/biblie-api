{"verse":"24","text":"When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them, â€œThink about what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area when you went there to see John [RHQ]. You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed the nature of his message [MET], like a reed that is blown back and forth by the wind [RHQ]."}

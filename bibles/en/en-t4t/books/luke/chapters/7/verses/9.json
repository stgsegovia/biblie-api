{"verse":"9","text":"When the officer’s friends arrived and told that to Jesus, he marveled at what the officer had said. Then he turned and said to the crowd that was going with him, “I tell you, I have never before found anyone who trusted in me like this non-Jewish man does. No one from Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, has trusted in me like he has!”"}

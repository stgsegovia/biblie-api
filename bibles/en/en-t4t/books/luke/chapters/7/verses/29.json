{"verse":"29","text":"When they heard what Jesus said (OR, what John preached), all the people, including tax collectors, whom many people despised, agreed that Godâ€™s way was right. By being baptized by John {By letting John baptize them}, they had agreed that what God required people to do in order to be saved was right."}

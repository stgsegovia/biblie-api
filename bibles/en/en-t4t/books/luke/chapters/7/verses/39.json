{"verse":"39","text":"When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw that, he thought, “Prophets know about other people’s lives, so if Jesus were a prophet, he would have known who this woman is who is touching him, and what kind of a person she is. He would have known that she is a prostitute! [EUP]”"}

{"verse":"14","text":"But the man in charge ◄of the synagogue/of the meeting place► was angry because Jesus had healed her ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►. He considered that healing was doing work. So he said to the people, “There are six days each week in which our Jewish laws permit people to work. If you need healing, those are the days to come ◄to the synagogue/to the meeting place► and be healed. Do not come on our Jewish day of rest!”"}

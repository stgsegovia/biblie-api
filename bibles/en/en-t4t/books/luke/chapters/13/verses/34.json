{"verse":"34","text":"Then Jesus said, â€œO people of [MTY] Jerusalem [APO]! You killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others, whom God sent to you, by throwing stones at them. Many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you [SIM] like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that."}

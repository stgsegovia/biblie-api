{"verse":"4","text":"They knew that their laws permitted it, but they thought that healing was work, which they thought was wrong to do ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► (OR, they knew that their laws permitted it, but they did not want to admit it). So they did not reply. Then Jesus put his hands on the man and healed him. Then he told him to go home."}

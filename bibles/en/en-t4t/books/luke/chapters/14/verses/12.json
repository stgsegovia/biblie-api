{"verse":"12","text":"Jesus also said to the Pharisee who had invited him to the meal, â€œWhen you (sg) invite people to a midday or evening meal, do not invite your friends or your family or your other relatives or your rich neighbors. They can later invite you (sg) for a meal. In that way they will repay you."}

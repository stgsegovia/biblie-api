I will condemn you by the very words [MTY] that you have just now spoken. ◄You know that I do not do foolish things with my money./Did you not know that I do not do foolish things with my money?► [RHQ] You said that I even take from others money that does not really belong to me, like a farmer who harvests grain from another man’s field where he did not even do the planting."}

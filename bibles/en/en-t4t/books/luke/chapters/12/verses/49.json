{"verse":"49","text":"â€œI came to earth to cause there to be trials [MET], which will purify you as fire purifies metal (OR, to cause judgment/divisions among you). I wish that the time when you will be purified {when God will purify you} (OR, when divisions will be caused {to cause divisions among people}) had already begun."}

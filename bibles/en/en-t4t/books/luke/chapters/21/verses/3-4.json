{"verse":"3-4","text":"He said to his disciples, “The truth is that these rich people have a lot of money, but they gave only a small part of it. But this woman, who is very poor, has put in all the money that she had to pay for the things she needs! So God considers that [HYP] this poor widow has put more money into the box than all the others.”"}

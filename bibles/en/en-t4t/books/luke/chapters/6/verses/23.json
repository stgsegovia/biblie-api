{"verse":"23","text":"When that happens, rejoice! Jump up and down because you are so happy! God will give you a great reward in heaven! When they do these things to you, it will prove that you are God’s servants. (OR, People have always treated God’s servants like that.) Do not forget that these people’s ancestors did the same things to the prophets who served God faithfully!"}

{"verse":"41","text":"◄Why do you notice someone else’s small faults?/None of you should be concerned about someone else’s small faults [MET, RHQ].► That would be like noticing a speck in that person’s eye. But you should be concerned about your own big faults. They are like planks in your own eye, which you do not notice."}

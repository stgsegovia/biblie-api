{"verse":"9","text":"Then Jesus told the people this parable to illustrate what God would do to the Jews who rejected the former prophets and himself: â€œA certain man planted a vineyard. He rented the vineyard to some men to care for it and to give him some of the grapes in return. Then he went to another country and stayed there several years."}

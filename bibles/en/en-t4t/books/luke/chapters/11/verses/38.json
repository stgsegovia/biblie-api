{"verse":"38","text":"The Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not follow the Phariseesâ€™ ritual by washing his hands before eating. The Pharisees washed their hands in a certain way to be cleansed from anything that might have contaminated them. They were afraid that God might reject them if they had touched something unacceptable to God."}

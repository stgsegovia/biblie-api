{"verse":"26","text":"As the soldiers were taking Jesus away, they seized a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene city in Africa. He was returning to Jerusalem from out in the countryside. They took from Jesus the cross that he had been carrying. Then they put it on Simonâ€™s shoulders, and told him to carry it behind Jesus."}

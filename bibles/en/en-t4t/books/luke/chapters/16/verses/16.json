{"verse":"16","text":"The laws that God gave Moses and what the prophets [MTY] wrote were ◄in effect/what you needed to obey► until John the Baptizer came. Since then I have been preaching about how God wants to rule people’s lives in a new way, and many people are accepting that message and very eagerly asking God to control their lives. But that does not mean that God has abolished the laws that he established previously."}

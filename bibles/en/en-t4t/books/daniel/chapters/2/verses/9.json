{"verse":"9","text":"If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you will be punished. I think that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things, because you hope that I will change ◄my mind/what I am thinking►. But tell me the dream, and then I will know that you can also tell me what it means.”"}

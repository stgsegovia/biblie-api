{"verse":"32","text":"Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them.‚Äù"}

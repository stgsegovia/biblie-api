{"verse":"33","text":"Immediately what God predicted happened. Nebuchadnezzar became insane, so his advisors forced him to live away from other people. He ate grass like cows do, and dew from the sky caused his body to be damp/wet every morning. He lived like that until his hair was as long as eagles’ feathers, and his fingernails became like birds’ claws."}

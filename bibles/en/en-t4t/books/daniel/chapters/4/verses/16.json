{"verse":"16","text":"That tree seems to have represented a man, because the angel also said, â€œCause that man to live out in the fields among the animals and plants. Cause the dew from the sky to make his body damp each morning. Do not allow him to continue to have a mind like humans; instead, cause him to have a mind like animals have, for seven years."}

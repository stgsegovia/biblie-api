{"verse":"2","text":"The angel also said, â€œAnd what I am going to reveal to you now will truly happen. There will be three more kings to rule Persia, one after the other. Then there will be a fourth king, who will be much richer than the others. As a result of his giving a lot of money to people, they will enable him to become very powerful. Then he will incite/persuade many nations [HYP] to fight against the kingdom of Greece."}

{"verse":"26","text":"After those 434 years, the leader/king whom God has appointed will be killed when it seems that he will have accomplished nothing ◄unjustly/without having done anything wrong►. After that, the temple will be destroyed by the army of a powerful ruler. The city and the temple will be destroyed like a flood [MET] destroys everything. That will be the beginning of the war and destruction that God has decreed will happen."}

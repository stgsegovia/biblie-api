{"verse":"7","text":"Lord, you always do what is righteous/just/fair, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDM]. This is still true about all of the Israelis who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea. It is also true about all us Israelis whom you scattered, who were taken to other countries, some near Israel and some far away, because we were very unfaithful/disloyal to you."}

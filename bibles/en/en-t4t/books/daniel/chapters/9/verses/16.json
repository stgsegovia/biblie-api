{"verse":"16","text":"Lord, Jerusalem is your city, and your temple was built there on your sacred hill. Now all the people who live in nearby countries/nations despise Jerusalem and us your people because of our sins and because of the evil things that our ancestors did. But now, because you do what is righteous/just, we ask you to not be angry with Jerusalem any longer."}

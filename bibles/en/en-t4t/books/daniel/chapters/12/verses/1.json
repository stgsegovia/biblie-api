{"verse":"1","text":"The angel also said to me, â€œAfter those things happen, the great angel Michael, who protects the Israeli people, will appear. Then there will be a time when there will be great troubles/suffering. The troubles will be greater than any troubles/suffering since the nations began. At that time, all of your people whose names have been written in the book containing the names of those who have eternal life will be saved."}

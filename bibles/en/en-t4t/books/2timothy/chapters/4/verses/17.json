{"verse":"17","text":"Nevertheless, the Lord was with me and strengthened me. He enabled me to fully preach the message, and all the non-Jewish people in the court (OR, people from many nations) heard it. And I was rescued by the Lord {the Lord rescued me} from great danger, as if I were taken [MET] out of a lion’s (OR, wild animal’s) mouth."}

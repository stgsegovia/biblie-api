{"verse":"10","text":"But as for yourself, you have fully known what I have taught. You have known and imitated the way in which I conducted my life, and what I have been trying to do. You have trusted God as I have. You have been patient as I have been. You have loved people as I have, and you have endured as you suffered like I have suffered."}

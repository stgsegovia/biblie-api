{"verse":"8","text":"Endure everything by remembering how Jesus Christ endured it when he suffered. Remember that he came back to life {God raised him from the dead} and God affirmed/declared him to be king as his ancestor King David was. Those are things that I tell to people when I tell them the message about Christ."}

{"verse":"14","text":"Those whom you appointed to teach others God’s truth, keep reminding them about these things that I have told you. Tell them strongly that, since God knows what they are doing (OR, that God will judge them for everything that is wrong that they do, and therefore) they must not quarrel ◄about words/about matters that are not important►, because, when teachers quarrel, it helps no one, and because, when they quarrel, they spiritually destroy those who hear them (OR, they cause those who hear them to quit ◄being committed to Christ/believing in Christ►.)"}

{"verse":"20","text":"In a wealthy person’s house there are not only utensils made of gold and of silver, but also utensils made of wood and of clay. The gold and silver utensils are used at special occasions/events, and the others are used at ordinary occasions. Similarly, in a congregation there are those who ◄are ready/desire► to do great things for the Lord Jesus, and there are those like the teachers of false doctrines/teachings who are not."}

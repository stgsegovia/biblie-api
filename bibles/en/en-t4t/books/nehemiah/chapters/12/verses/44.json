{"verse":"44","text":"On that day, men were appointed {they appointed men} to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people contributed for the temple. They also kept there the other things that the people contributedâ€” the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. Those men collected those things from the fields/farms near the cities, and took them to Jerusalem and gave them to the priests and the other descendants of Levi, as Moses had said in his laws that they should do. All the Israeli people were happy about the work that the priests and the descendants of Levi did,"}

{"verse":"27","text":"When we dedicated the wall around Jerusalem, we summoned the descendants of Levi who help the priests from the nearby places where they were living. We asked them to join with us to celebrate when we dedicated the wall. We wanted them to sing songs to thank Yahweh and make music by playing cymbals and harps and other stringed instruments."}

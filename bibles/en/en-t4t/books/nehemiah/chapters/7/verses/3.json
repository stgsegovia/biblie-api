{"verse":"3","text":"I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until late each morning. And close the gates and put the bars across the doors ◄late in each afternoon/before sunset► while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates.” I also told them to appoint some people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards on the wall, and to assign some of them to be guards at certain other places and to assign others to guard the area close to their own houses."}

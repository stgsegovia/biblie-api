{"verse":"39","text":"The descendants of Levi and some of the other Israeli people must take 10% of the offerings of grain, wine, and olive oil to the storerooms where the various utensils that are used in the temple are kept. That is the place where the priests who are serving at that time, the temple guards, and those who sing in the temple choir live."}

{"verse":"15","text":"Shallum the son of Colhozeh, who ruled Mizpah District, repaired the Fountain Gate. He put/built a roof over the gate, and put in their places the gates and the bolts and the bars for locking the gate. Near the Pool of Shelah he built the wall next to the kingâ€™s garden, as far as the steps that went down from the City of David."}

{"verse":"29","text":"â€œYou warned them that they should again obey your laws, but they became proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed your commands. They sinned by disobeying what you commanded them to do, the things that would enable them to live a good long life if they obeyed them. They stubbornly refused [IDM] to listen to you and continued sinning."}

{"verse":"2","text":"So he asked me, “Why are you sad? I know that you are not sick. It must be that you are troubled about something.” Then I was very afraid, because it was not proper to be sad when I came to the king (OR, because I was worried what the king would do to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to do)."}

{"verse":"1","text":"After King Artaxerxes had been ruling the Persian Empire for almost 20 years, ◄during the spring/before the hot season► of that year, when it was time to serve wine to him during a feast, I took the wine and gave it to him. I had never looked sad when I was in front of him before, but on that day he saw that I looked very sad."}

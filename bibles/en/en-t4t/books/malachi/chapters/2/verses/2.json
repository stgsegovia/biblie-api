{"verse":"2","text":"The Commander of the armies of angels says this: â€œPay attention to what I am saying, and then decide [IDM] to honor me [MTY]. If you do not do that, I will curse you, and I will curse the things that I have given to you to bless you. And I have already cursed them, because you have not honored [IDM] me."}

{"verse":"12","text":"When the Jews sinned (OR, rejected Christ), the result was that God abundantly blessed other people in [MTY] the world by offering them the opportunity to believe. And when the Jews failed spiritually, the result was that God abundantly blessed the non-Jews. Since that is true, think how wonderful it will be when the complete number of the Jews whom God has chosen will believe in Christ [RHQ]!"}

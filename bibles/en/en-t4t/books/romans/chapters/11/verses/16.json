{"verse":"16","text":"Just like the whole lump of dough will belong to God if people offer to God [MET] the bread baked from the first part of it [MET], so the Jews will belong to God because their ancestors belonged to God. And just like the branches of a tree will be good if the roots are good [MET], so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to God."}

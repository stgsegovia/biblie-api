{"verse":"3","text":"Because God has kindly appointed me to be his apostle, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you: Do not think about yourselves more highly than what is right for you to think! Instead, think about yourselves in a sensible way that corresponds to the abilities that God has given you because you trust in Christ."}

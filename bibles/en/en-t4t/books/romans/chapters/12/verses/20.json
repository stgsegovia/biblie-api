{"verse":"20","text":"Instead of doing something evil to those who have done something evil to you, do as the Scriptures teach: “If your (sg) enemies are hungry, feed them! If they are thirsty, give them something to drink! By doing that, you (sg) will cause them to feel ashamed and perhaps they will change their attitude toward you [IDM].”"}

But if her husband dies, she is freed from having to {no longer has to} obey the law about remaining married to her husband."},{"book":"Romans","chapter":"7","verse":"3","text":"Therefore, a woman will be called {people will call a woman} an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she no longer has to obey that law.

That is because it is as though we died with Christ when he was crucified. Now you and I belong to someone else [MET], like a woman who marries again after her husband dies belongs to another man. Specifically, you and I belong to Christ, who has come back to life {whom God has caused to live again after he died}, in order that we may live righteously [IDM] to honor God."},{"book":"Romans","chapter":"7","verse":"5","text":"When our self-directed nature controlled us, desires that led us to sin were acting in our bodies.

The result is that now we are not controlled by those rituals {those rituals do not control us now}.

[MTY]/Are not the laws that God gave Moses evil if they stir up our sinful desires?►” [MTY, RHQ] I would reply that they certainly are not evil, even though our sinful desires are increased. What I would reply is that I, for example, realized that what I was doing was sinful only because of what is written {Moses wrote} in those laws. For example, I realized that coveting is sinful only because he wrote in those laws [PRS], “You must not covet.”"},{"book":"Romans","chapter":"7","verse":"8","text":"And because of what that commandment stated, my sinful desire to have things that belong to others [PRS] caused me to covet in many ways.

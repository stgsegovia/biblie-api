But ever since he created the world, by means of what he created he has clearly revealed what he is like. He has made clear to everyone that he has always been able to do very powerful things. Therefore, we should recognize that God is powerful, completely different from all that he created.

Instead, they strongly desired to have sexual relations with other men. They committed homosexual acts with other men, acts that were shameful.

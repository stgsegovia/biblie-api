{"verse":"5","text":"But suppose that we do not do things to gain Godâ€™s acceptance. Suppose that we instead trust in God, who erases the record of sins of wicked people. Then the erasing of the record of our sins because of our trusting in Christ is considered to be a gift to us, not something that we earned."}

{"verse":"16","text":"And there is another way in which God’s freely erasing the record of our sins is not like the results of Adam’s sinning. One person, Adam, sinned. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it."}

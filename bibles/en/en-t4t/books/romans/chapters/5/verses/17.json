{"verse":"17","text":"All people die [MET, PRS] because of what one man, Adam, did. But now many of us experience that God has abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule with Christ (OR, share the glory of Christâ€™s being king), in heaven. This will happen because of what one man, Jesus Christ, did for us."}

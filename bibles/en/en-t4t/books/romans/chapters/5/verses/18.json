{"verse":"18","text":"So, because one man, Adam, disobeyed God’s law, that resulted in all people deserving to be punished {that God punish them}. Similarly, because one man, Jesus, acted righteously by obeying God when he died, the result was that God is able to erase the record of all people’s sins and enable them to live eternally."}

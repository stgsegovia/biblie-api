{"verse":"1","text":"God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil things, because he has clearly revealed that he is angry with them. So, when God judges people, he will not excuse any one of you Jews to whom I am writing. You (sg) say that God should punish non-Jews for doing evil things. But when any one of you says that, it is you yourself whom you are saying that God should punish, because you (sg) do some of the same evil things that the non-Jews do."}

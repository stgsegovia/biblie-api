{"verse":"12","text":"Although non-Jews do not have the laws that God gave to Moses, all non-Jews who sin will be eternally separated from God. He will not consider whether or not they knew the laws that he gave to Moses. And all the Jews who have sinned in spite of knowing the laws that God gave to Moses will also be punished {God will also punish them}. They will be punished for disobeying Godâ€™s laws."}

{"verse":"25","text":"I thank God that it is by Jesus Christ our Lord that we can be free from the control of what our bodies desire. So, with our minds, you and I on the one hand want to obey Godâ€™s laws. But also, you and I often let our sinful desires control us because of our self-directed nature."}

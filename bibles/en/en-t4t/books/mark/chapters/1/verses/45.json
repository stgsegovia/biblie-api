{"verse":"45","text":"The man went and presented himself to the priest. But then he began to tell many people about how Jesus had healed him [DOU]. As a result, Jesus was no longer able to enter any town publicly because the crowds would surround him. Instead, he remained outside the towns in places where no people lived. But people kept coming to him from all over that region."}

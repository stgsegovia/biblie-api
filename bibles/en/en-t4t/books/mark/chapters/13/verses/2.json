{"verse":"2","text":"Jesus said to him, “Yes, these buildings that you are looking at [RHQ] are wonderful, but I want to tell you something about them. They will soon be destroyed {Foreign invaders will destroy them} completely, with the result that no stone here in this Temple area will be left on top of another stone.”"}

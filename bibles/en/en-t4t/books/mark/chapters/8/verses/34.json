{"verse":"34","text":"Then he summoned the crowd along with his disciples so that they might listen to him. He told them, â€œIf any one of you wants to be my disciple, you must not do only what you yourself want to do. Specifically, you must be willing to allow people to hurt you and to disgrace you. That is what they do to criminals who are forced to carry crosses [MET] to the places where they will be crucified. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do."}

{"verse":"15","text":"Later, Jesus was eating a meal in Leviâ€™s house. Many men who collected taxes and other people who were considered to be sinning regularly were eating with Jesus and his disciples. This was not surprising, for there were many people like this who were going everywhere with Jesus."}

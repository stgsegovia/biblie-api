{"verse":"18","text":"The disciples of John the Baptizer and some men who belonged to the Pharisee sect used to abstain from food to show that they wanted to please God. One day, some people came to Jesus and asked him critically, “The disciples of John and the Pharisees ◄fast/abstain from food► from time to time, but your disciples do not. We think they should abstain from food also. What do you say about that [RHQ]?”"}

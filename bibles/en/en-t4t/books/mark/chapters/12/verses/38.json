{"verse":"38","text":"While Jesus was teaching the people, he said to them, â€œBeware that you do not act like the men who teach our Jewish laws. They like people to honor them, so they put on long robes and walk around in order to show people how important they are. They also like people to greet them respectfully in the marketplaces."}

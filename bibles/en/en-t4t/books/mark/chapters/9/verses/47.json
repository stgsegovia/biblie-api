{"verse":"47","text":"If because of what you see [MTY, PRS] you are tempted to sin, stop looking at those things! Even if you have to gouge out your eye and throw it away [HYP] to avoid sinning, do it! It is good that you not sin and live eternally, even though you lack one of your eyes while you are here on earth. But it is not good that you sin and, as a result, God puts your whole body in hell."}

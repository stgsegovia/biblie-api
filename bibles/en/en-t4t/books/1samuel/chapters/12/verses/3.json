{"verse":"3","text":"Now tell me, while Yahweh is listening, and while the king whom he has chosen is listening: whose ox or donkey have I stolen during all those years? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed/treated badly? From whom have I accepted a bribe, in order that I would ignore the evil things he had done? If I have done any of those things, tell me, and I will pay back what I owe.‚Äù"}

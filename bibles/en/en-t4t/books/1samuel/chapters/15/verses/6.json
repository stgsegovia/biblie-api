{"verse":"6","text":"Then Saul sent this message to the Ken people-group who lived in that area: “You acted kindly toward all our Israeli ancestors when they left Egypt. But we are going to kill all of the Amalek people-group, because they opposed/attacked our ancestors. So move away from where the Amalek people-group live. If you do not move away, you will be killed when they are killed.” So when  the Ken people-group heard that, they immediately left that area."}

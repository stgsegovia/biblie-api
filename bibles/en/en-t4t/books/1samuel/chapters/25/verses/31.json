{"verse":"31","text":"When that happens, you will be glad that you did not kill any people in Nabal’s household. You will not think that you deserve to be punished for having taken revenge yourself and killed innocent people. And when Yahweh enables you to successfully become the king, please do not forget to be kind to me.”"}

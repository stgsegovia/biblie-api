{"verse":"17","text":"One day Saul said to David, “I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh against the Philistines”. He said that because he thought, “I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines to do that.”"}

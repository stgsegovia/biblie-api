{"verse":"25","text":"Saul replied, “Go and say to David, ‘In order for  the king to allow you to marry Michal, he wants you to kill 100 Philistines and cut off their foreskins and bring the foreskins to him to prove that you have killed them. In that way he will get revenge on his enemies.’ ” But what Saul wanted was that the Philistines would kill David while David was trying to kill them."}

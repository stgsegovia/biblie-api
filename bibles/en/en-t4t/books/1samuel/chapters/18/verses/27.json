{"verse":"27","text":"David and his men went and killed, not 100, but 200 Philistines! He brought their foreskins to Saul, and counted them while Saul was watching, in order to prove that he had done what the king required so that he could become Saulâ€™s son-in-law. So then Saul was obligated to allow David to marry his daughter Michal."}

{"verse":"9","text":"Watch the cart as the cows pull it. If they pull it to Beth-Shemesh town in Israel, we will know that it was the Israelis’ god who caused us to experience this plague. But if they do not take it there, we will know that it was not the god [MTY] of the Israelis who has punished us. We will know that it just happened.”"}

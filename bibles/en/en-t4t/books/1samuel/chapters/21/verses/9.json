{"verse":"9","text":"Ahimelech replied, “I have only the sword that belonged to Goliath the giant from the Philistia people-group whom you killed in Elah Valley. It is wrapped in a cloth, and is behind the sacred vest in the Sacred Tent. If you want it, take it, because I have no other weapon here.”"}

{"verse":"14","text":"But now because of what you have done, you will die, and after you die, none of your descendants will rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man to be king who will be just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be the leader of his people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he commanded.‚Äù"}

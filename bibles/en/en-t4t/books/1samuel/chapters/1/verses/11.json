{"verse":"11","text":"She made a vow saying, “O Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, if you will look at me and see how miserable I am, and think about me and allow me to give birth to a son, then I will dedicate him to you to serve you for the rest of his life. And to show that he is dedicated to you, ◄no one will ever be allowed to cut his hair/his hair will never be cut►.”"}

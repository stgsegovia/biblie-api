{"verse":"3","text":"Once every year Elkanah went up with his family from Ramah to Shiloh city. He went there to worship Yahweh, the commander  of the armies of angels, and to offer sacrifices to him. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, helped their father to do the work as priests of Yahweh there."}

{"verse":"47","text":"After Saul became the ruler/king of the Israeli people, his army fought against their enemies in many areas. They fought against armies of the Moab people-group, the Ammon people-group, the Edom people-group, the kings of Zobah city/area, and the Philistia people-group. Wherever the Israeli army fought, they defeated their enemies."}

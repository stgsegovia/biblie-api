{"verse":"8","text":"So Saul took off the clothes that showed that he was the king, and he put on ordinary clothes ◄to disguise himself/so that people would not recognize who he was►. Then he and two of his men went during the night to talk to that woman. Saul said to her, “I want you to talk to a spirit of someone who has died. Cause to appear the person whose name I will give to you.”"}

{"verse":"3","text":"While Samuel was still alive, Saul did many things that pleased Yahweh. One of the good things that Saul did was to expel from Israel all the people who were fortune-tellers or who talked to the spirits of dead people. But Samuel had died, and all the Israeli people had mourned for him. Then they had buried him in Ramah, his hometown. After that, Saul did not try to please Yahweh any more."}

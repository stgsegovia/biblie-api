{"verse":"28","text":"From all the tribes of the Israeli people, I chose him and his male descendants to be priests for me. I appointed them to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear a sacred apron as they worked for me. And I declared that they could take and eat some of the meat that the Israeli people burned on the altar."}

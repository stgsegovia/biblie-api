{"verse":"9-11","text":"Saul said, “Okay, let’s go talk to him.” So they went to the town where the prophet lived. As they were going up the hill into the town, they met some young women who were coming out of the town to get some water from a well. One of them asked the women, “Is the seer in the town today?” They said that because previously, if people in Israel wanted a message from God, they would say, “Let’s go to the seer,” and people who now are called prophets were at that time called ‘those who see ◄visions from God/all that God sees►.’"}

{"verse":"24","text":"So the cook brought the leg and the meat that was on it, and set it in front of Saul, even though those portions were for only the priest to eat. Samuel said to Saul, “Start eating it. I told the cook to save this for you, so that you could eat it at this time, when all these people whom I invited are here.” So Saul and Samuel ate together."}

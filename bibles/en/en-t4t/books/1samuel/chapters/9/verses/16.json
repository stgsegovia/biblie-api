{"verse":"16","text":"“At this time tomorrow, I will send to you a man from the land where the descendants of Benjamin live. Pour olive oil on his head to indicate that he will be the leader of my Israeli people. I have seen that my people are suffering because the Philistine people are oppressing them, and I have heard my people as they have called out to me for help. The man on whose head you pour olive oil will rescue my people from the [MTY] Philistine people.”"}

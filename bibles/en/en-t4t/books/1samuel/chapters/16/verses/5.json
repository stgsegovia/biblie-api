{"verse":"5","text":"Samuel replied, “Yes. I have come peacefully, to make a sacrifice to Yahweh. Perform the rituals to make yourselves acceptable to Yahweh, and then come with me to where they will offer the sacrifice.” Then Samuel performed the ritual to make Jesse and his sons acceptable to God, and he also invited them to the sacrifice."}

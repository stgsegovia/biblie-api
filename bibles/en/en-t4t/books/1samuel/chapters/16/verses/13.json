{"verse":"13","text":"So as David stood there in front of his older brothers, Samuel took the container of oil that he had brought and poured some of it on David’s head to set him apart to serve God. After they all ate, Samuel left  and returned to Ramah. But Yahweh’s Spirit came on David powerfully, and stayed with David for the rest of his life."}

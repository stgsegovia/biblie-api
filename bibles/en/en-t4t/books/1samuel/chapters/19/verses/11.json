{"verse":"11","text":"Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house. He told them to watch the house and to kill David while he was leaving the house the following morning. But David’s wife Michal saw them and warned him, “To survive, you must run away tonight, because if you do not do that, you will be killed tomorrow!”"}

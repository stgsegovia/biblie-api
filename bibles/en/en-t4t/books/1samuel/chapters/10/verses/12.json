{"verse":"12","text":"One of the men who lived there replied, “Saul cannot be a prophet, because all prophets receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents.” And that is why, when people hear about a report of someone prophesying, they think about what happened to Saul and say, “We are surprised about that person becoming a prophet, like we were surprised to hear that Saul had really become one of the prophets.”"}

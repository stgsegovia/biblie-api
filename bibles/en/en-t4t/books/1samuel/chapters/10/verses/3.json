{"verse":"3","text":"When you arrive at the large oak tree at Tabor town, you will see three men coming toward you. They will be on their way to worship God at Bethel town. One of them will be leading three young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a container of wine."}

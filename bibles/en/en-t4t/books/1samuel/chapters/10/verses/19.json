{"verse":"19","text":"I am the one who saves you from all your troubles and difficulties. But today you have rejected me, your God, and you have said, ‘We don’t care! Give us a king!’ So I will do what you want. Now have representatives of your tribes and of  your clans stand here in the presence of Yahweh.’ ”"}

{"verse":"5","text":"When you arrive at the hill where people worship God near Gibeah town, where there is the camp where the Philistine soldiers stay, you will meet a group of prophets who will be coming down from the altar on top of the hill. There will be people in front of them who will be playing various musical instruments: a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre. And all of them will be speaking messages that come directly from God."}

{"verse":"41","text":"When the boy left, David came out from the south side of the pile of stones behind which he had been hiding. He went to Jonathan and bowed in front of Jonathan three times, with his face touching the ground. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other on the cheek/neck, and they cried together. But David cried more than Jonathan."}

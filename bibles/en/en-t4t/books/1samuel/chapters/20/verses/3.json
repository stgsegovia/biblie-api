{"verse":"3","text":"Then David solemnly declared this to Jonathan: “Your father knows very well that you and I are very good friends, so he says to himself, ‘I will not tell Jonathan what I am going to do. If I tell Jonathan, he will be upset/distressed, and then he will tell David.’ But just as certain as Yahweh lives and you live, I am only one step away from being killed.”"}

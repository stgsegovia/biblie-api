{"verse":"39","text":"When Jesus said that, he was referring to Godâ€™s Spirit, whom those who believed in Jesus would receive later. Up to that time God had not sent the Spirit to live within believers, because Jesus had not yet died and returned to his glorious home in heaven, from where he would send the Spirit."}

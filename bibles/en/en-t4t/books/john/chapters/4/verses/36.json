{"verse":"36","text":"If you help them to accept my message, I will reward you [MET], as an owner of a field pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.’ I have been telling people God’s message. That is like [MET] a man who plants seeds. You will help people to accept my message. That will be like [MET] harvesting crops. When that happens, both you and I will rejoice."}

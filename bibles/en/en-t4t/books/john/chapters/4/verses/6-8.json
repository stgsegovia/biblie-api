{"verse":"6-8","text":"The well that used to belong to Jacob was on that plot of ground. Jesus was tired from walking. So while we disciples went into the town to buy some food, he sat down alongside the well. It was about noontime. A woman who lived there in Samaria came to get some water from the well. Jesus said to her, “Will you give me from the well some water to drink?” The woman knew that Jews did not like ◄to touch things that belong to Samaritans/to come near Samaritans►, (OR, Jews did not like to associate with Samaritans,)"}

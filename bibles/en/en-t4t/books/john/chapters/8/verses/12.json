{"verse":"12","text":"Jesus spoke to the people again. He said, “I am like a light [MET] for all the people in [MTY] the world. Just like a light reveals what has been in the darkness [MET], I reveal God’s truth to them. Those who walk in the darkness are unaware of what is around them. But those who become my disciples will always be aware of God’s truth [MET]. They will have my light which shows them how to have eternal life.”"}

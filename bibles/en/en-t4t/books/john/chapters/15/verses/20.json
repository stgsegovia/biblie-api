{"verse":"20","text":"Remember these words that I told you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ That means that you, who are like my servants, cannot expect people to treat you better than they treat me. So, since they have ◄persecuted me/caused me to suffer►, they will ◄persecute you/cause you to suffer► also. If they had paid attention to the things I taught them, they would pay attention to what you teach them."}

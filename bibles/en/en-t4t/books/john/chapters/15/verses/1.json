{"verse":"1","text":"Jesus talked to us as we were walking along. Speaking figuratively of the need for us to live in a way that God wants us to, he said, â€œI am like [MET] a genuine vine, not like those Jewish leaders who do not teach the truth. My father is like [MET] a gardener who works to take care of a vineyard."}

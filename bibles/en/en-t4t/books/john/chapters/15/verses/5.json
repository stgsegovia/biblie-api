{"verse":"5","text":"I am like [MET] a vine. You are like [MET] the branches. All those who have a close relationship with me and with whom I have a close relationship will do much that pleases God, like [MET] a vine that bears much fruit. Remember that you can do nothing [HYP] that truly pleases God without my help."}

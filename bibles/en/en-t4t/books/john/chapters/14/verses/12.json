{"verse":"12","text":"Listen to this carefully: You who trust in me will do the kinds of miracles that I have done. Because of what I will do for you (OR, Because I will send Godâ€™s Spirit to you) after I go to my Father, you will be able to do miracles that will be greater than the ones I have done."}

{"verse":"17","text":"I am talking about the Spirit, who will teach you Godâ€™s truth. He will be with you forever. Those who are opposed to God [MTY] cannot receive him, because they cannot understand what he does, and they cannot know who he is. But you know who he is, because he is with you and he will be inside you."}

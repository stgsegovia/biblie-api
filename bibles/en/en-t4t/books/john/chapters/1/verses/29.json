{"verse":"29","text":"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. He said to the people, â€œLook! Here is the man whom God has appointed to be a sacrifice [MET], like the lambs that the people of Israel sacrificed! By sacrificing himself he will make it possible for everyone in the world to be no longer guilty for having sinned."}

{"verse":"38","text":"Later, Joseph, from Arimathea town, went to Pilate and asked Pilate to allow him to take Jesus’ body down from the cross. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but he did not tell anyone that, because he was afraid of the other Jewish leaders [SYN]. Pilate permitted him to take Jesus’ body, so he went, along with others, and they took Jesus’ body down from the cross."}

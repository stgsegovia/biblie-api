{"verse":"16","text":"And I have other people who are not Jews who will some day belong to me. They will be like [MET] sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them to God/myself also. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually all those who belong to me will be like one flock, and I will be like [MET] their one shepherd."}

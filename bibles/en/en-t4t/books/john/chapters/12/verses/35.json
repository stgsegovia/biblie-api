{"verse":"35","text":"Then Jesus said to them, â€œMy message is like [MET] a light for you. I will be with you for only a little while longer. Live and act as you should while I am still with you, because suddenly you will have no more opportunity to hear my message! You do not want to be like [MET] someone who cannot see where he is going any more when it suddenly becomes dark!"}

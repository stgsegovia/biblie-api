{"verse":"41","text":"Jesus said to them, “If you realized that you did not yet know God’s truth, but you wanted to, then you would be like blind people who wanted to see. God would be able to forgive your sins. But you are now falsely claiming that you know God’s truth, so you are like people who are blind who claim that they can see. Because of that, God is not able to forgive your sins.”"}

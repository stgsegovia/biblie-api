{"verse":"39","text":"Jesus said, “I have come into this world to judge the people in the world. The result will be that those who realize that they do not know God’s truth will perceive it. That is like [MET] enabling those who are blind to see. But the result will also be that people who falsely think [IRO] that they understand God’s truth will never understand it. That is like [MET] people who are blind remaining blind permanently.”"}

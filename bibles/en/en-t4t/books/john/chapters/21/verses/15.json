{"verse":"15","text":"When we had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “John’s son Simon, do you love me more than these other disciples do?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, like [MET] a shepherd provides food for his lambs.”"}

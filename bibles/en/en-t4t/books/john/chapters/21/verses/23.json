{"verse":"23","text":"Some of the other believers heard a report of what Jesus had said about me, and they thought that Jesus meant that I would not die. But Jesus did not say that I would not die. He said only, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, ◄that is not your concern!/what is that to you?► [RHQ]”"}

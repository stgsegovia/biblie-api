{"verse":"17","text":"Jesus said to him a third time, “John’s son Simon, am I really dear to you (OR, do you really love me)?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, and because the third time he changed the question. He said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me (OR, that I love you).” Jesus said, “Give to those who belong to me what they need spiritually, as [MET] a shepherd provides food for his sheep."}

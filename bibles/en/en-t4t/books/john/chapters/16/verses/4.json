{"verse":"4","text":"I have told you these things in order that when they start ◄to cause you to suffer/to persecute you► [MTY], you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you these things when you first started to accompany me [MTY] because I was with you, and they were causing trouble for me, not for you.”"}

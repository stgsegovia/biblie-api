{"verse":"13","text":"But God’s Spirit is the one who will teach you God’s truth. When he comes, he will guide you so that you understand all spiritual truth. He will not speak from his own authority. Instead, it is the things that he hears my Father say that he will tell you. He will also tell you about things that will happen later."}

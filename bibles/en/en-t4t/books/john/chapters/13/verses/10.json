{"verse":"10","text":"Then, to show him that after God had cleansed people from being guilty for sin, they needed only for God to forgive their daily sins [MET], Jesus said to him, “Those who have recently bathed need only to have their feet washed, because they get dirty very quickly on the dusty roads. The rest of their bodies are clean. Similarly, I have made you disciples free/clean from the guilt of your sins, although not all of you are free from guilt.”"}

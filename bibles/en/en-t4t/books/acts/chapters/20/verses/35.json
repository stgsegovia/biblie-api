{"verse":"35","text":"In everything that I did, I showed you that we (inc) should work hard in order to have enough money to give some to those who are needy. We (inc) should remember that our Lord Jesus himself said, ‘You are happy when people give you what you need, but God will be happy with you when you give other people what they need.’”"}

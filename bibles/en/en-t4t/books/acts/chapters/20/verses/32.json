{"verse":"32","text":"â€œNow as I leave you, I ask God to protect you and to keep you believing the message that he saves us(inc) by doing for us what we do not deserve. If you continue believing the message that I told you, you will become spiritually mature, and God will give you the blessings that he has promised to give to all of those who belong to him."}

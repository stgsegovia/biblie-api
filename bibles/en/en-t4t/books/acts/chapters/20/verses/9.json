{"verse":"9","text":"A young man whose name was Eutychus was there. He was seated on the sill of an open window on the third story of the house. As Paul continued talking for a long time, Eutychus became sleepier and sleepier. Finally, he was sound/really asleep. He fell out of the window from the third story down to the ground. Some of the believers went down immediately and picked him up. But he was dead."}

{"verse":"10","text":"But Paul did not want to do that. So he said to Festus, â€œNo, I am not willing to go to Jerusalem! I am now standing before you, and you (sg) are the judge whom the Roman Emperor [MTY] has authorized. This is the place where I should be judged {where you should judge me}. I have not wronged the Jewish people at all, as you know very well."}

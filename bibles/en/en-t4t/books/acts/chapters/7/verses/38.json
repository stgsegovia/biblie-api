{"verse":"38","text":"This man Moses was our people’s leader when they gathered together in the desert. It is Moses to whom God sent the angel on Sinai Mountain to give him our laws, and he was the one who told our other ancestors what the angel had said. He was the one who received from God words that tell us how to live eternally, and Moses passed them on to us.”"}

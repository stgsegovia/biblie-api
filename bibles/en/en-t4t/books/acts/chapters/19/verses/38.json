{"verse":"38","text":"Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow-workmen want to accuse anyone about anything bad, they should do it in the right way. There are courts that you can go to when you want to accuse someone, and there are judges there who have been appointed by the government {whom the government has appointed}. You can accuse anyone there."}

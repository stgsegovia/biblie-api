{"verse":"5","text":"Paul replied, “My fellow Jews, I am sorry that I said that. I did not know that the man who told one of you to hit me is the high priest. If I had known that, I would not have insulted our supreme priest, because I know that it is written {that Moses wrote} in our Jewish law, ‘Do not speak evil of any of your rulers!’”"}

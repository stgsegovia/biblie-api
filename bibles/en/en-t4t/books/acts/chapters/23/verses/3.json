{"verse":"3","text":"Then Paul said to Ananias, “God will punish you (sg) for that, you hypocrite [MET]! You sit there and judge me, using the laws that God gave Moses. But you yourself disobey those laws, because you commanded me to be struck {these men to strike me} without having proved that I have done anything that is wrong!”"}

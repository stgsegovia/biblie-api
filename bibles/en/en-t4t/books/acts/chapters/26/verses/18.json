{"verse":"18","text":"to help them to realize [MTY] what is true and to stop believing what is false [MET]. I am sending you to them so that they may let God control them and not let Satan control them any more. Then God will forgive their sins and will accept them as his people because they believe in me.’ That is what Jesus said to me.”"}

{"verse":"11","text":"The Jews in Thessalonica had not been very willing to listen to Godâ€™s message, but the Jews who lived in Berea were very willing to listen, so they listened very eagerly to the message about Jesus. Every day they read the Scriptures for themselves to find out if what Paul said about the Messiah was true."}

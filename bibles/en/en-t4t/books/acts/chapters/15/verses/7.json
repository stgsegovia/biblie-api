{"verse":"7","text":"After they had discussed it for a long time, Peter stood up and spoke to them. He said, â€œFellow believers, you all know that a long time ago God chose me from among you other apostles, in order that the non-Jewish people might also hear me [SYN] tell them the good message about the Lord Jesus, so that they could hear it and believe in him. So Paul and Barnabas are not the first ones to tell non-Jews about Jesus."}

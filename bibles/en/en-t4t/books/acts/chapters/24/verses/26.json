{"verse":"26","text":"Felix said that because he hoped that Paul would give him some money to allow Paul to get out of prison. So he repeatedly sent for Paul to come, and Paul repeatedly went and talked with him. But he did not give Felix any money, and Felix did not command his soldiers to release Paul from prison."}

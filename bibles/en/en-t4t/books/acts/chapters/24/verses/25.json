{"verse":"25","text":"Paul explained to them about what God requires people to do in order to please him. He also explained about God requiring people to control how they act. Paul also told him that there will be a time when God will judge people. Felix became alarmed after hearing those things. So he said to Paul, “That is all I want to hear now. When there is a time that is convenient I will ask you (sg) to come to me again.”"}

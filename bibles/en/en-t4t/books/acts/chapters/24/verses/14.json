{"verse":"14","text":"But I admit to you (sg) that this is true: I do worship the God that our ancestors worshipped. It is true that I follow the way that Jesus taught us. The Jewish leaders call that a false religion/teaching. I also believe everything that was written by Moses {that Moses wrote} in the laws that God gave him, and everything that was written by the other prophets {that the other prophets wrote} in their books [MTY]."}

{"verse":"27","text":"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He explained to the apostles how, while Saul was traveling along the road to Damascus, he had seen the Lord Jesus and how the Lord had spoken to him there. He also told them how Saul had preached boldly about Jesus [MTY] to people in Damascus. The apostles believed Barnabas and told the other believers about that."}

{"verse":"17","text":"After Paul had been there three days, he sent a message to the Jewish leaders to come and talk with him. So they came, and Paul said to them, â€œMy fellow Jews, although I have not opposed our people nor spoken against the customs of our ancestors, our leaders in Jerusalem seized [MTY] me. But before they could kill me, a Roman commander rescued me and later sent me to Caesarea for Roman authorities/officials to put me on trial."}

{"verse":"15","text":"A group of believers who lived in Rome had heard that we (exc) were coming. So they came out from Rome to meet us. Some of them met us at the town called ‘The Market on Appian Road’, and others met us at the town called ‘The Three Inns’. When Paul saw those believers, he thanked God and was encouraged."}

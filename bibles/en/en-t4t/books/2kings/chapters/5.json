I will write a letter for you to take to the king of Israel, saying that I sent you.” The king wrote in the letter, “I am sending this letter with my army commander Naaman, who serves me faithfully. I want you to heal him of his disease.” So Naaman, assuming/thinking that the king of Israel was the prophet, took the letter and 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing, to give to the king of Israel, and he went to Samaria, taking along several servants."},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"7","text":"When he arrived in Samaria, he gave the letter to the king of Israel. The king read the letter. Then, being very dismayed, the king tore his clothes and said, “I am not God [RHQ]! I am not able to enable people to live or to die [RHQ]! Why does the king who wrote this letter request me to cure this man of his leprosy? I think that he is just wanting to start a fight with me!”"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"8","text":"But the prophet Elisha heard that the king of Israel had torn his robe and said that. So he sent a message to the king, saying, “Why are you upset/frustrated [RHQ]?

Instead, he sent a messenger to Naaman, to tell him, “Go to the Jordan River and wash yourself seven times in the river. Then your skin will be restored/healed, and you will no longer have leprosy.”"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"11","text":"But Naaman became very angry. He said, “I thought that surely he would wave his hand over the leprosy, and pray to Yahweh his god, and heal me!"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"12","text":"Surely the Abana River and the Pharpar River in Damascus in my own country of Syria are [RHQ] better than any of the rivers in Israel! Why can I not wash in those rivers and be healed?” [RHQ] So he turned and walked away with great anger/disgust."},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"13","text":"But his servants came to him, and one of them said, “Sir, if that prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would certainly [RHQ] have done it.

They stood in front of him, and Naaman said, “Now I know that there are no real gods anywhere else in the world, but there is a God here in Israel!

This dirt here in Israel is holy, so please allow me to take some dirt from this place and put it in sacks on two mules. Then I will take it back home with me and make an altar on this dirt. From now on, I will offer sacrifices to Yahweh on that altar. I will not offer sacrifices to any other god."},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"18","text":"However, when my master, the king, goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship him/it there, and he is leaning on my arm, I hope/desire that Yahweh will forgive me because I will have to bow down, too.”"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"19","text":"Elisha replied, “Go home, and do not worry about that.” So Naaman and his servants started to travel home."},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"20","text":"But then Elisha’s servant Gehazi said to himself, “It is not good that my master allowed this Syrian man to leave like this. He should have accepted his gifts. So just as certainly as Yahweh lives, I will go and catch up with Naaman and get something from him.”"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"21","text":"So Gehazi hurried to catch up with Naaman.

Elisha has sent me to tell you that he would like 75 pounds of silver and two sets of clothing to give to them.”"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"23","text":"Naaman replied, “Certainly! You can have 150 pounds of silver!” He urged Gehazi to take it. He also gave him two sets of clothing.

This is certainly not [RHQ] the time to accept gifts of money and clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and servants!"},{"book":"2 Kings","chapter":"5","verse":"27","text":"Because you have done this, you and your children and all your descendants, forever, will have leprosy just like Naaman had!” And when Gehazi left the room, he was a leper! His skin was as white as snow!"}]}

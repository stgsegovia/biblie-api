{"verse":"6","text":"But he did not execute their children. He obeyed what was written in the laws that God gave to Moses: “Parents must not be executed for the crimes/sins committed by their children, and children must not be executed for crimes/sins committed by their parents. People must be executed only for the sins that they themselves have committed.”"}

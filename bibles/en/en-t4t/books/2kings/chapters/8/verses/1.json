{"verse":"1","text":"After Elisha caused the son of the woman from Shunem town to become alive again, he told her that she should leave with her family and live somewhere else for a while, because Yahweh was going to ◄send a famine/cause food to become very scarce► in the land. He said that the famine would last for seven years."}

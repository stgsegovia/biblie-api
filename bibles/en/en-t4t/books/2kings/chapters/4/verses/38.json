{"verse":"38","text":"Then Elisha returned to Gilgal. But at that time there was ◄a famine/very little food► in that area. One day as the group of prophets was sitting in front of Elisha listening to what he was teaching, he said to his servant, “Put a large pot on the stove and make some stew for these men.”"}

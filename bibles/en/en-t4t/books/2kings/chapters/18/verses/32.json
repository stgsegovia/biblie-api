{"verse":"32","text":"You will be able to do that until we come and take you to a land that is like your landâ€”a land where there is grain to make bread and vineyards to produce grapes for making wine. It will be a land that has plenty of olive trees and honey. If you do what the king of Assyria commands, you will not die. You will continue to live."}

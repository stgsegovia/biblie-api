{"verse":"20-21","text":"Joash’s officials plotted against him, and two of them killed Joash on the road that goes down to the Silla district. The two men who did that were Jozabad, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer. Joash was buried in the place where his ancestors were buried, in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. Then Joash’s son Amaziah became the king of Judah."}

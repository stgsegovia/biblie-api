{"verse":"18","text":"So Joash, the king of Judah, took all the money that the previous kings, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, had dedicated to Yahweh. He added some of his own money, and all the gold that was in the rooms in the temple where valuable things were kept/stored, and the gold in his palace, and sent it all to King Hazael, to ◄appease him/persuade him to not attack Jerusalem►. So King Hazael took his army away from Jerusalem."}

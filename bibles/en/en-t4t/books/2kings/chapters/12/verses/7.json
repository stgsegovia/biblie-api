{"verse":"7","text":"So Joash summoned Jehoiada and the other priests and said to them, “◄Why are you not repairing things in the temple?/You should have been repairing things in the temple!► [RHQ] From now on, you must not keep the money that you receive from people who know you (OR, the treasurers). You must give it to the people who will be repairing things in the temple!”"}

{"verse":"12","text":"Elisha saw it. He cried out, “My father/master! My father/master! The chariots of us Israeli people and their drivers have taken my master away!” They disappeared into the sky, and Elisha never saw Elijah again. Then Elisha tore his own robe into two pieces to show that he was sad."}

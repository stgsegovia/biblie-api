{"verse":"16","text":"Then many of the people of Samaria also went out of the city and went to where the army of Syria had previously set up their tents. They entered all the tents and took everything. So there was now plenty of everything! As a result people could buy ten pounds of fine wheat or 20 pounds of barley for only one piece of silver, which was what Yahweh had said would happen!"}

{"verse":"8","text":"When those four lepers came to the edge of the area where the soldiers of Syria had set up their tents, they went into one tent, and saw all the things that had been left there. So they ate and drank what was there, and they took the silver and the gold and clothes. Then they went outside the tent and hid those things. Then they entered another tent, and took things from there, and then went outside and hid them, also."}

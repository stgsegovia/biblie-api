{"verse":"24","text":"Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that would be completely burned on the altar that was there in Samaria. But Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to them, “I want you to kill all the people who are in the temple. Anyone who allows one of them to escape will be executed!”"}

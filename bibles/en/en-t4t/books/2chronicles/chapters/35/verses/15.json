{"verse":"15","text":"The musicians, who were descendants of Asaph, stood in their places, as King David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s prophet had commanded. The men who guarded the gates of the temple did not need to leave their places, because their fellow descendants of Levi prepared food for them to eat."}

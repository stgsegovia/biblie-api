{"verse":"11","text":"Solomon moved his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt, from the place outside Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’ to the place that his workers had built for her. He said, “I do not want my wife to live in the palace that my father King David’s workers built, because the Sacred Chest was in that palace for a while, and any place where the Sacred Chest has been is holy.”"}

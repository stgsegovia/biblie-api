{"verse":"6","text":"Then King Asa gathered all the men of Judah, and they took away from Ramah all the stones and timber that Baashaâ€™s men had been using to build the wall around that town. They took those materials to the town of Geba and the city of Mizpah north of Jerusalem and built walls around them."}

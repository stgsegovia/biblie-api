{"verse":"8","text":"When Asa heard what the prophet Azariah said, he was encouraged. He commanded his workers to remove all the detestable idols from everywhere in the land of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and from the towns that his soldiers had captured in the hills of the tribe of Ephraim. Asaâ€™s workers repaired the altar where people offered sacrifices  to Yahweh that was in front of the entrance to the temple in Jerusalem."}

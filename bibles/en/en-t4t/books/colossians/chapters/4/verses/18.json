{"verse":"18","text":"I, Paul, ◄am thinking fondly about you/send you my greetings►. Having taken the pen from my scribe, I am now writing this myself in order that you may know that I have truly sent this letter. Remember to pray about the fact that I am in prison [MTY]. I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ would continue to act graciously towards you all."}

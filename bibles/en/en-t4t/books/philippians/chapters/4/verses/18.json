{"verse":"18","text":"But I have received a very generous gift [EUP] from you, and as a result, I have plenty. I have an abundant supply of what I need because I have received from Epaphroditus the money [EUP] that you sent to me. God considers that your gift is very acceptable, and he is very pleased with it. Your gift is like a nice-smelling sacrifice [MET]."}

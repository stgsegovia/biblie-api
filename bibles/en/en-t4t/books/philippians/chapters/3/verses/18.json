{"verse":"18","text":"Keep in mind that there are many people who say that they believe in Christ, but who act in such a way that shows that they are opposed to the teaching about Christ dying on the cross [MTY]. I have told you about those people many times before, and now I am sad, even crying, as I tell you about them again."}

{"verse":"4","text":"What will happen is that the army of the King of Assyria will invade those countries and capture many of the people and take them away as their prisoners. They will force all them, including both the young ones and the old ones, to walk naked and barefoot. They will also force them to have no clothes around their buttocks, which will cause the people of Egypt to be ashamed."}

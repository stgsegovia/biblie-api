{"verse":"20","text":"Then they will bring back here your relatives who have been ◄exiled/forced to go to other countries►, to be like [SIM] an offering to me. They will come on horses, in chariots, on mules, and on camels. They will come to Zion, my sacred hill in Jerusalem. That will be like [SIM] the offerings that my Israeli people used to bring in the correct manner to the temple."}

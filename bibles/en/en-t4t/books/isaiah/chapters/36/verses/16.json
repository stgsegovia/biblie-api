{"verse":"16","text":"Do not pay attention to what Hezekiah says! This is what the king of Assyria says: â€˜Come out of the city and surrender to me. If you do that, I will arrange for each of you to drink the juice from your own grapevines and to eat figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own well."}

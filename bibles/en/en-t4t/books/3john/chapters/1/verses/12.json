{"verse":"12","text":"All the believers who know Demetrius say that he is a good person. The fact that he conducts his life in a way that is consistent/in accordance with Godâ€™s true message shows that he is a good person, and we also say the same thing about him. You know that what we say about him is true. So it will be good if you welcome him and help him. He is the one who will be bringing this letter to you."}

{"verse":"12","text":"three years of famine in Israel, or three months during which your armies will run away from their enemies who will attack them with swords, or three days during which I will send my angel to cause many people in the country to die because of a ◄plague/very serious illness►.’ So, you must decide what I will say to answer Yahweh, the one who sent me.”"}

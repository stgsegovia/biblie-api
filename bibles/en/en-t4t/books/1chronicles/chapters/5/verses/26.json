{"verse":"26","text":"So the God whom the Israelis worshiped caused Pul, the king of Assyria, to conquer those tribes. Pulâ€™s other name was Tiglath-Pileser. His army captured the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh, and took them to various places in Assyria: Halah, Habor, Hara and near the Gozan River. They have lived in those places from that time to the present time."}

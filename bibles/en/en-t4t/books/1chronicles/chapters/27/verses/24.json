{"verse":"24","text":"Joab and his helpers started to count the men of Israel, but they did not finish counting them because Joab knew that Yahweh was angry about their being counted. Yahweh punished [MTY] the people of Israel because of this counting, and as a result the total number of Israeli men able to serve in the army was not written on the scroll about King Davidâ€™s rule."}

{"verse":"15","text":"â€œ'The king instructed him to take the cups back to Jerusalem, to the place from which they had previously been taken. He also decreed that they should rebuild the temple at the place where it had been before. So Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar to be the governor in Judah. He also sent all those things made of gold and silver, for Sheshbazzar to put in the new temple."}

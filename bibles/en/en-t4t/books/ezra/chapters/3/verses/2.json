{"verse":"2","text":"Then Jeshua, the son of Jehozadak, and his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his friends, all began to rebuild the altar of God, the one whom the Israeli people worshiped. They did that in order that they could sacrifice burned offerings on it, according to what the prophet Moses had written in the laws that God gave to him."}

{"verse":"18","text":"At that time, I told you three tribes, â€˜Yahweh our God is giving you this land east of the Jordan River, for you to occupy/capture. So now, give your soldiers weapons, and send them across the Jordan River ahead of the men from the other Israeli tribes to help them to conquer/capture the land that has been allotted to them."}

{"verse":"19","text":"Do not forget the terrible plagues that your ancestors saw Yahweh inflict on the people of Egypt, and the many [DOU] miracles that he performed, and the very powerful [DOU, MTY] way by which he brought your ancestors out of Egypt. Yahweh our God will do the same kind of things to the people-groups that you are afraid of now."}

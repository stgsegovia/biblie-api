{"verse":"14","text":"You must offer them only in the place that Yahweh will choose for you, in an area that belongs to one of your tribes. That is the only place where he wants you to offer sacrifices that will be completely burned on the altar, and to do the other things that I am commanding you to do when you worship him."}

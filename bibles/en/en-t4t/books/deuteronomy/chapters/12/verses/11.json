{"verse":"11","text":"“Yahweh will choose one place where he wants you to worship him. That is the place to which you must bring all the offerings that I command you to bring: The sacrifices that must be completely burned on the altar, your other sacrifices, other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, ◄your tithes/ten percent of all your crops►, and all the special offerings that you will solemnly promise to give to Yahweh."}

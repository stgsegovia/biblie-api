{"verse":"22","text":"Those are the commandments that Yahweh spoke to your ancestors. When they were gathered there at the bottom of the mountain, he spoke with a very loud voice from the middle of the fire, and there were dark clouds surrounding the mountain. He spoke only those ten commandments, no more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me."}

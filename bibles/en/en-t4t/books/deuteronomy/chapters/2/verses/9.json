{"verse":"9","text":"Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not bother/harass the people of Moab, and do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you any of their land. Do not forget that they are descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot, and I have given to them Ar city, their capital, and the other areas in that country.’ ”"}

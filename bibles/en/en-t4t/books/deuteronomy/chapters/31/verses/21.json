{"verse":"21","text":"And they will experience many terrible disasters. After that happens, their descendants will never forget this song, and it will be like a witness that says, ‘Now you know why Yahweh punished your ancestors.’ I will soon take them into the land that I vowed that I would give to them; but now, before I do that, I know what they are thinking that they will do when they are living there.”"}

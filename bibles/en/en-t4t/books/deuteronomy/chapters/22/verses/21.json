{"verse":"21","text":"they must take that young woman to the door of her father’s house. Then the men of that city must execute her by throwing stones at her. They must do that because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by having sex with some man while she was still living in her father’s house. By executing her like that, you will get rid of this evil practice among you."}

{"verse":"7","text":"“But if the dead man’s brother does not want to marry that woman, she must stand at the ◄gate/central meeting place► of the town and say to the town elders, ‘My husband’s brother will not do ◄his duty/what he is supposed to do►. He refuses to marry me in order that I may give birth to a son who will  prevent my dead husband’s name from disappearing in Israel.’"}

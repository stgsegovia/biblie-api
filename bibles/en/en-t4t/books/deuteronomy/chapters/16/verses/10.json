{"verse":"10","text":"Then, to honor Yahweh our God, celebrate the Harvest Festival. Do that by bringing to him an offering of grain. Yahweh has blessed you by causing it to grow in your fields during that year. If you had a big harvest, bring a big offering. If you had a small harvest, bring a small offering."}

{"verse":"10","text":"Tell them about the day that your ancestors stood in the presence of Yahweh our God at Sinai Mountain, when he said to me, ‘Gather the people together, in order that they can hear what I say. I want them to learn to have an awesome respect for me as long as they are alive, and I want them to teach their children to do that also.’"}

{"verse":"34","text":"Certainly no other god has ever tried to take a huge group of people from one nation to another location, like he did for us when he brought us out of Egypt. We saw Yahweh our God use great power [MTY, DOU] when he performed many kinds of [DOU] miracles, and sent plagues, and did many other very terrifying things in Egypt for us, and rescued us when the army of Egypt tried to fight against us."}

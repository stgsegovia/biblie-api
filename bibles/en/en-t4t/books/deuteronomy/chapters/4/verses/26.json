{"verse":"26","text":"Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and everyone who is on the earth [MTY] to watch what you are doing. If you disobey what I am telling you, you will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan River to occupy. You will not live very long there; Yahweh will completely get rid of many [HYP] of you."}

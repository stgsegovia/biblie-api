{"verse":"13","text":"Then you must say to Yahweh, â€˜I have brought to you, from my house, all of the sacred tithe from my harvest this year. I am giving it to the descendants of Levi, to the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, as you commanded us to do. I have not disobeyed any of your commands about the tithes, and I have not forgotten any of your commands about tithes."}

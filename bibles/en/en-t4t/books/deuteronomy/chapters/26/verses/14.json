{"verse":"14","text":"I declare that I have not eaten any food from the tithe while I was mourning for someone who died. And I have not touched any of it while I was unacceptable to you; I have not offered any of it to spirits of dead people. Yahweh, I have obeyed you and done everything that you have commanded us concerning the tithe."}

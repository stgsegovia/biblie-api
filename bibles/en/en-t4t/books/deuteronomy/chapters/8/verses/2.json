{"verse":"2","text":"And do not forget how Yahweh our God led us as we traveled through the desert during these past 40 years. He caused you to have many problems/difficulties, because he wanted to cause you to realize that you needed to trust him and not yourselves. And he wanted to test you, to find out what you intended to do [IDM], whether you would obey his commandments or not."}

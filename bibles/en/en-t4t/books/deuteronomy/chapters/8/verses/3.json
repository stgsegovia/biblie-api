{"verse":"3","text":"So he caused you to have/experience difficulties. He allowed you to become hungry. Then he gave you manna food from heaven, food that you and your ancestors had never eaten before. He did that to teach you that people need food for their bodies; but they also need food for their spirits, which comes from paying attention to everything that Yahweh says [MTY]."}

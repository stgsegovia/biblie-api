{"verse":"6","text":"Do not sin by promising to do something and then not doing it. And when you promise God to do something and do not do it, do not say to Godâ€™s priest that it was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God will certainly [RHQ] become very angry with you, and he will take from you everything that you [SYN] have worked to acquire."}

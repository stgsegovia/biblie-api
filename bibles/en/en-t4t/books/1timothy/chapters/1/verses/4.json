{"verse":"4","text":"And tell people to not continually give their attention to stories that tell about our ancestors, stories in which there are ◄genealogies/lists of our ancestors’ names► that seem to be endless. You must command your congregation not to think that these stories are valuable, because whenever people think that, they just start arguing about things uselessly, instead of teaching God’s plan, which is concerned with what we believe (OR, which we know because we trust in Christ)."}

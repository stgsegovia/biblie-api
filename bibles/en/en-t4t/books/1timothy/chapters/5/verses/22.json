{"verse":"22","text":"Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man ◄to set him apart/to appoint him► as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his life, because God will consider that you are responsible if you approve a person who sins, saying that he should become an elder. Keep your life pure in every way."}

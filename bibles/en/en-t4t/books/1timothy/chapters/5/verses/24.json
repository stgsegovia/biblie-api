{"verse":"24","text":"I tell you not ◄to set apart/appoint► elders hastily, without seeing how they conduct their lives, because some people sin secretly, so that it is not known what they have done until after someone examines them (OR, before God judges them). But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them."}

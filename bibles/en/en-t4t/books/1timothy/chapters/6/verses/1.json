{"verse":"1","text":"As for slaves [DOU] who are believers, teach them that they should consider that it is right for them to honor their masters in every way. If they do that, people will not speak ◄against/evil about► God [MTY] and they will not speak ◄against/evil about► that which we apostles teach, because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their masters."}

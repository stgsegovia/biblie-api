{"verse":"21","text":"Because God will severely punish them, it would have been better for them if they had never known what it means to live in a righteous way. It is too bad that although they knew how to live in a righteous way, they stopped doing the things that God commanded people to do, the things that were taught to them ◄by us apostles/by Christ► {that ◄we apostles/Christ► taught to them}."}

{"verse":"13","text":"God will punish those teachers in return for the unrighteous actions/things that they have done. They even like ◄to carouse/to drink and revel noisily► in the daytime as well as at night. And as they indulge/enjoy themselves just like they want to while they are feasting with you, they cause you to become impure, as [MET] stains and blotches [DOU] ruin a clean garment."}

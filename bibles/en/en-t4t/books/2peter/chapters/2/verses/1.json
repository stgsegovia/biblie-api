{"verse":"1","text":"Just like there were false prophets among the Israeli people long ago, so there will also be teachers who teach false things among you. They will enter your congregations without you realizing what/who they are, and they will spiritually injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even deny that the Lord Jesus died to pay for the guilt of our sins. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves spiritually, and God will also punish them."}

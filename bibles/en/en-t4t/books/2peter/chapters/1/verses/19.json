{"verse":"19","text":"We also have the Scriptures that the prophets wrote about Christ long ago, which are completely reliable/trustworthy. You should ◄pay attention to/think carefully about► what they wrote, because what they wrote enables you to know whether what is taught to you is true or whether it is false [SIM], like a lamp that is shining in a dark place enables people to see where they are going [SIM]. You should ◄pay attention to/think carefully about► what they wrote until our Lord Jesus Christ comes back and enables you [SYN] to know God fully, which will be like when [MET] ◄a day dawns/daylight comes► and the morning star rises and we can see it clearly."}

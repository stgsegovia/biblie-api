{"verse":"4","text":"Being glorious and perfect, he has promised us that he will do very great and ◄priceless/very precious► things for us. He has also promised you that by believing what he has promised you will be able to act righteously, just like God acts righteously, and that you will be free from being morally depraved/corrupted, and that you will not be like those who do not believe in Christ and are morally depraved because of their desire to do things that are evil."}

{"verse":"3","text":"God [PRS] has given us everything that we need in order that we might receive eternal life and in order that we might live  ◄in a godly way/in a way that pleases him►. He gives us that by the power that he has because he is God, and he has also given it to us as a result of our knowing him. He is the wonderful and perfect one who chose us to be his people."}

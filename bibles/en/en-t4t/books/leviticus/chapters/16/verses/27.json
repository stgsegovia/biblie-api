{"verse":"27","text":"The carcasses of the bull and the goat that were slaughtered to be an offering/sacrifice for the peopleâ€™s sins, whose blood was taken inside the Very Holy Place to enable Yahweh to forgive the Israeli people, must be carried outside the camp and burned. The hides/skins of the animals, the inner organs, and the dung must also be burned."}

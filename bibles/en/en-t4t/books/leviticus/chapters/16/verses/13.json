{"verse":"13","text":"There he must put the incense on the burning coals, with the result that a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die like Korah’s two sons did because of offering incense incorrectly (OR, because of being in God’s presence)."}

{"verse":"15","text":"“Aaron must then go outside the Sacred Tent and slaughter the goat to be an offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the Very Holy Place behind the curtain. There he must sprinkle some of that blood on the lid of the sacred chest and against the front of the chest, like he did with the bull’s blood."}

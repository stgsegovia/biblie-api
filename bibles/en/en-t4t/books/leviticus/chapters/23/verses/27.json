{"verse":"27","text":"“You must celebrate a day on which you request that I forgive you for the sins that you have committed. That day will be nine days after the festival when the priests blow the trumpets. On that day you must ◄fast/abstain from eating food►. You must gather together to worship me and present offerings to me that will be burned on the altar."}

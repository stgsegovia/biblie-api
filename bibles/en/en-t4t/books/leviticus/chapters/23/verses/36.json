{"verse":"36","text":"On each of the seven days of the festival, they must present to me an offering of animals that will be burned on the altar. On the next day, they must gather again to worship me and present to me another animal that will be burned on the altar. That also will be a sacred gathering, and they must not work on that day, either."}

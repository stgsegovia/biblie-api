{"verse":"18","text":"Along with this bread, you must present to me seven one-year-old lambs with no defects, one young bull, and two rams. They must all be completely burned on the altar. All those offerings, with the grain offering and the wine offering, will be burned, and the smell of all those things burning will be very pleasing to me."}

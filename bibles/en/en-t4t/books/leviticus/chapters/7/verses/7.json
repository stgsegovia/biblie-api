{"verse":"7","text":"â€œhe regulation is the same for the offerings to enable people to be forgiven for the sins they have committed  and the offerings for when they are guilty of not giving to me the things that are required to be given to me. The meat of those offerings belongs to the priest who offers them in order that the people will be forgiven."}

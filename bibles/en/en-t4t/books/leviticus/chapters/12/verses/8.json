{"verse":"8","text":"If a woman who gives birth to a child cannot afford a lamb, she must bring two doves or two young pigeons. One will be burned completely on the altar, and one will be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to God again. By doing that, the priest will cause that she will be forgiven for any sins she has committed, and she no longer will need to be avoided.’”"}

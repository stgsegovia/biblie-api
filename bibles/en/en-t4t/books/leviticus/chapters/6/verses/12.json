{"verse":"12","text":"The fire on the altar must always be kept burning; the priest must not allow it to ◄go out/quit burning►. Each morning the priest must put more firewood on the fire. Then he must arrange more offerings on the fire, and burn on the altar the fat of the offerings to be burned to maintain fellowship with me."}

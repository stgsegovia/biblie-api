{"verse":"14","text":"But you and your sons and daughters are permitted to eat the breast and the thigh that were lifted up in front of Yahweh. Eat them in any place that is ◄holy/acceptable to him►. They have been given to you and your descendants as your share of the offerings to enable the Israelis to maintain fellowship with Yahweh."}

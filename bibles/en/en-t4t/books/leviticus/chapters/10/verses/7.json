{"verse":"7","text":"But you must not leave the entrance of the Sacred Tent to join those who are mourning, because if you do that, you also will die, and Yahweh will punish [MTY] all the people of Israel. Do not forget that Yahweh has set you apart [MTY] to work for him here, and he does not want you to become defiled by touching a corpse.‚Äù So they did what Moses/I told them to do."}

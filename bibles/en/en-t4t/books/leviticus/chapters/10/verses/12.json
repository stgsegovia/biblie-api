{"verse":"12","text":"Moses/I said to Aaron and his two sons who were still alive, Eleazar and Ithamar, â€œTake the offering made from grain that is left after a portion of it has been offered to Yahweh to be burned, and eat it alongside the altar. It should not be eaten elsewhere, because it is very holy."}

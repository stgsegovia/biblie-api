{"verse":"6","text":"Then Moses/I said to Aaron and his other two sons Eleazar and Ithamar, â€œYou are sad because Nadab and Abihu died, but you must act like you always do. Do not allow the hair on your heads to remain uncombed, and do not tear your clothes. But your relatives and all your fellow Israelis are allowed to mourn for those whom Yahweh destroyed by fire."}

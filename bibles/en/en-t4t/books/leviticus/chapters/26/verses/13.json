{"verse":"13","text":"I am Yahweh your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt in order that you would no longer be slaves of the people of Egypt. When you were there, you were treated as though you were animals that worked for the people of Egypt, but [MET] I broke the bars of the ◄yokes/frames that were put around your necks► and enabled you to walk with your heads up.”"}

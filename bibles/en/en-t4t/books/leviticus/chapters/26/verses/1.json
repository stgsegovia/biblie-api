{"verse":"1","text":"Yahweh also said this to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain: â€œDo not make idols or set up statues of false gods or sacred stones to worship other gods. And do not put on your property a stone that has been shaped to resemble a false god and bow down to worship it. You must worship only me, Yahweh, your God."}

{"verse":"32","text":"When one of those creatures dies and falls on something, the thing that it falls on, whatever it is used for, will become ◄defiled/unacceptable to me►, whether it is made of wood or cloth or the hide of some animal or from rough cloth. You must put it in water. Then you must not use it until that evening."}

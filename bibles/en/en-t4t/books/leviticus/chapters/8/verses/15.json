{"verse":"15","text":"Then Moses/I slaughtered the bull, caught some of its blood in a bowl, and with his/my finger put some of that blood on the projections at the corners of the altar, to purify the altar. He/I poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. By doing that, he/I caused it to be a suitable place for burning sacrifices for sin."}

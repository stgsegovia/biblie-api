{"verse":"18","text":"There were several wells in that area that had been dug when Isaacâ€™s father Abraham was living, but Philistine people had filled them up with dirt after Abraham died. Now Isaac and his servants removed the dirt, and Isaac gave the wells the same names that his father had given to them."}

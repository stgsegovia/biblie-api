{"verse":"22","text":"They moved on from there and dug another well, but this time no one quarreled about who owned it. So Isaac named it Rehoboth, which means ‘uninhabited place’, saying, “Yahweh has given us an uninhabited place to live in, a place that is not wanted by other people, and we will become very prosperous here.”"}

{"verse":"21","text":"When Yahweh smelled the pleasant odor, he was pleased with the sacrifice. Then he said to himself, â€œI will never again devastate everything on the earth because of the sinful things people do. Even though everything that people think is evil from the time they are young, I will not destroy all the living creatures again, as I did this time."}

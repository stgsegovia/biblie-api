{"verse":"14","text":"Then Yahweh God said to the snake, â€œBecause you did this, of all the livestock and the wild animals, I will curse/punish you alone. As a result, you and all other snakes will scurry across the ground on your bellies, and so what you eat will have dirt on it as long as you live."}

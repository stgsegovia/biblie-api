{"verse":"24","text":"After Yahweh expelled them, on the east side of the garden he placed ◄cherubim/creatures with wings► and an angel holding a flaming sword which flashed back and forth. He did that in order to block the entrance to the garden, so that people could not go back to the tree that enables people who eat its fruit to live forever."}

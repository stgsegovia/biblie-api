{"verse":"13","text":"Jacob had no intention to go with Esau, but he said, “You know, sir, that the children are weak, and that I must take care of the female sheep and cows that are ◄sucking their mother’s milk/nursing their young►. If I force them to walk fast for a long distance in just one day, the animals will all die."}

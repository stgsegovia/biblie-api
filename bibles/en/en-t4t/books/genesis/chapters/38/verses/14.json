{"verse":"14","text":"She realized that now Shelah was grown up, but Judah had not given her to him to be his wife. So she took off her widow’s clothes, and covered her head with a veil, so that people would not ◄recognize her/know who she was►. Then she sat down at the entrance to Enaim town, which is on the road to Timnah."}

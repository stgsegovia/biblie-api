{"verse":"16","text":"When Jacob returned from the wheat fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. She said, “You must sleep with me tonight, because I gave Rachel some of my son’s mandrakes that enable women to become pregnant, to pay her for allowing us to do that.” So Jacob slept with her that night."}

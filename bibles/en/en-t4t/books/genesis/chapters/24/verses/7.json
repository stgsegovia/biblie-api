{"verse":"7","text":"Yahweh God, who created the heavens, brought me here. He brought me from my father’s household, and from the land where my relatives lived. He spoke to me and made a solemn promise to me, saying, ‘I will give this land of Canaan to your descendants.’ He will send an angel who will go there ahead of you, and enable you to get a wife for my son there and bring her to live here."}

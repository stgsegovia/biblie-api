{"verse":"24","text":"Because of what they said, Joseph realized that they admitted that what they had done to him many years previously was wrong. He could not keep from crying, and he did not want them to see him crying, so he left them and went outside the room and began to cry. But then he returned to them and talked to them again. Then he took Simeon, and while they were watching, he told his servants to tie him up. He left Simeon in the prison and told the others that they could go."}

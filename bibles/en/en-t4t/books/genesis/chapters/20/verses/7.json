{"verse":"7","text":"Now, return this man’s wife to her husband, because he is ◄a prophet/a man who receives messages from me►. He will pray for you, and you will ◄remain alive/not die►. But if you do not return her to him, you will certainly die, and all the members of your household will also certainly die.”"}

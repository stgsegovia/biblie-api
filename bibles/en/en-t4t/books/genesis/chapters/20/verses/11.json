{"verse":"11","text":"Abraham replied, “I said that because I thought, ‘They certainly do not respect God in this place. If they don’t respect God, they will not respect relationships with others. If I say she is my sister, they will try to pay me a bride price to get her. But if I say she is my wife, they will kill me to get her.’"}

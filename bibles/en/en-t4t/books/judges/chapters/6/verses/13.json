{"verse":"13","text":"Gideon replied, “Sir, if Yahweh is helping us, why have all these bad things happened to us? We heard about [RHQ] all the miracles that Yahweh performed for our ancestors. We heard people tell us about how he rescued them from being slaves in Egypt. But now Yahweh has abandoned us, and we are ruled by the people from Midian.”"}

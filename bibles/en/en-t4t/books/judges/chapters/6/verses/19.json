{"verse":"19","text":"Gideon hurried to his home. He killed a young goat and cooked it. Then he took ◄a half a bushel/18 liters► of flour and baked some bread without yeast. Then he put the cooked meat in a basket, and put the broth from the meat in a pot, and took it to Yahweh, who was sitting under the tree."}

{"verse":"1","text":"The men of the tribe of Ephraim summoned their soldiers, and they crossed the Jordan River to the town of  Zaphon to talk with Jephthah. They said to him, “◄Why did you not ask us for help?/You should have requested us► to help your army fight the Ammon people-group. So we will burn down your house while you are in it.”"}

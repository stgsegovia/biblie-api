{"verse":"35","text":"When Jephthah saw his daughter, he tore his clothes to show that he was very sad about what he was going to do. He said to her, “My daughter, you have caused me to become very sad [DOU] because I made a solemn promise to Yahweh to sacrifice the first one who came out of my house, and I must do what I promised.”"}

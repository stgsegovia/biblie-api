{"verse":"19","text":"Then Yahwehâ€™s Spirit powerfully took control of Samson. He went down to the coast at Ashkelon town, and killed 30 men. He took their clothes and went back to Timnah and gave them to the men who had told him the meaning of the riddle. But he was very angry about what had happened, so he went back home to live with his mother and father."}

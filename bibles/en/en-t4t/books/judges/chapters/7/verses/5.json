{"verse":"5","text":"When Gideon took the men down to the spring, Yahweh told him, “When they drink, put into one group the ones who scoop the water into their hands, and then lap it up like dogs do. Put into another group the ones who kneel down and bend over and drink with their mouths in the water.”"}

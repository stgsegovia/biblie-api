{"verse":"2","text":"When Yahweh first began to give messages to me to tell to the people of Israel, he said to me, “Go and marry a prostitute. But some of her children will be born as a result of her having sex with men to whom she is not married. That will illustrate how the people of Israel have turned away from me and worship ◄idols/other gods►.”"}

{"verse":"29","text":"God will reward those who, because of being my disciples, have left behind a house or plot of ground, their brothers, their sisters, their father, their mother, their children, or any other family [MTY] members. God will give them 100 times as many benefits as they have given up. And they will live with God eternally."}

{"verse":"17","text":"As you can calculate, I have grouped Jesusâ€™ ancestors as follows: There was a succession of 14 of them from the time when Abraham lived to the time when King David lived. There was a succession of 14 of them from the time when David lived to the time when the Israelites were taken {the Babylonian army took the Israelites} away to Babylon. There was a succession of 14 of them from the time when the Israelites were taken {the Babylonian army took the Israelites} away to Babylon until the time when the Messiah was born."}

{"verse":"20","text":"While he was seriously considering this, much to his surprise, in a dream he saw an angel whom the Lord had sent. The angel said, â€œJoseph, descendant of King David, do not be afraid that you(sg) would be doing wrong if you(sg) would marry Mary. Instead, begin to treat her as your wife, because the Holy Spirit, not a man, has caused her to be pregnant."}

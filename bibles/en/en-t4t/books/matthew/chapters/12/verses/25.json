{"verse":"25","text":"But Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking and saying. So, in order to show them that what they said did not make sense, he said to them, â€œIf the people in [MTY] one nation fight against each other, they will destroy their nation {their nation will be destroyed}. If people who live in the same city or house fight each other, they will certainly not remain as one group or family."}

{"verse":"13-14","text":"“Going to where people live eternally with God in heaven is difficult. It is like going along a narrow road [PRS, MET] that leads to a narrow gate. Not many people find that way. The way that most people take is easy, but it results in their being punished {God punishing them} in hell. That way is like a wide road that people walk on [PRS, MET] until they reach the wide gate, but that road and that gate lead to where they will be destroyed {God will destroy them}. Many people enter that gate. So I am telling you to leave the wide road and enter the narrow gate to heaven.”"}

{"verse":"7","text":"â€œKeep asking God for what you need. If you do that, he will give it to you. Confidently keep expecting God to give you the things that you need, and he will give them to you. It will be like [MET] looking for what you need and finding it. Keep on praying persistently to God. Then God will answer you. It will be like [MET] knocking on a door in order to enter a room. And the way will be opened {God will open the way} for you to get what you pray for."}

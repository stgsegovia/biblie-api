{"verse":"13","text":"After the men who studied the stars left Bethlehem, an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. He said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you (sg) that you should leave, because King Herod is about to send soldiers to look for the child so that they can kill him.”"}

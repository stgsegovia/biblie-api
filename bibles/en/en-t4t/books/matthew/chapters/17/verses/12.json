{"verse":"12","text":"But note this: Elijah’s representative has already come, and our leaders have seen him, but they did not recognize him as the one who would come before the Messiah. Instead, they treated him badly, just like they desired. And those same rulers will soon treat me, the one who came from heaven, in the same manner.”"}

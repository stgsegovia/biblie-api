{"verse":"25","text":"He answered them, “Yes, he does pay it.” When we came into the house where Jesus was saying, before Peter began to talk about paying taxes, Jesus said to him, “Simon, from whom do you think rulers collect revenue or taxes? Do they collect taxes  from the citizens of their own country, or from citizens of countries they have conquered?”"}

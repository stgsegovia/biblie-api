{"verse":"20-21","text":"He answered us, “It is because you did not believe very much in God’s power. Think about this: Mustard seeds are very small, but in this area they grow and produce large [MET] plants. Similarly, if your faith grows until you truly believe that God will do what you ask him to, you will be able to do anything [LIT]! You could even say to this hill, ‘Move from here to there!’ and it would go where you told it to go.”"}

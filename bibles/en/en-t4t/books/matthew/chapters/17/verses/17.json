{"verse":"17","text":"Jesus responded by saying to everyone who had gathered there, “You who have seen how I help people do not believe that you can do anything! Your minds are distorted! How long do I have to be with you before you are able to do what I do [RHQ]? How long do I have to endure your not believing [RHQ]? Bring the boy here to me!”"}

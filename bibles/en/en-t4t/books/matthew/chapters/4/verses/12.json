{"verse":"12","text":"While Jesus was in Judea, John the Baptizerâ€™s disciples told him that John had been put in prison and kept there {that Herod Antipas had put John the Baptizer in prison and kept him there}. So Jesus returned to Galilee District. While he was in Galilee, he first went to Nazareth town."}

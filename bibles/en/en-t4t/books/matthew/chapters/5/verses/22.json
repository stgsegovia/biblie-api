{"verse":"22","text":"But what I say to you is this: If you are angry with someone, God will judge you. If you say to someone, ‘You are worthless,’ the Jewish Council will judge you. If you hate someone, and say to them 'You fool!' you. yourself, will be in danger of being thrown into the fires in hell."}

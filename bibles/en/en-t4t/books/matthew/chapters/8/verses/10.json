{"verse":"10","text":"When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, â€œListen to this: I have never before found anyone who has as firm a faith in me as this non-Jewish man has. Not even in Israel, where I would expect people to believe in me, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!"}

{"verse":"34","text":"Then it seemed as if all the people [HYP] who lived in that town [MTY] went to meet Jesus. When they saw him and the two men who had been controlled by the demons, they begged Jesus to leave their region because they thought that he would destroy more things than just the pigs (OR, because they realized he must be very powerful)."}

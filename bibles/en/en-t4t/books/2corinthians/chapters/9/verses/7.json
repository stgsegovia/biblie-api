{"verse":"7","text":"Each of you should decide how much you (sg) should give, and then give that amount. You (sg) should not be thinking to yourself, “I really do not want to give this money.” And you(sg) should not give just because someone tells you to give. Instead, you should give willingly and cheerfully, because God loves those who give cheerfully."}

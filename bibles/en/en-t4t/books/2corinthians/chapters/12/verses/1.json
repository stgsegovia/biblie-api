{"verse":"1","text":"It seems that I must go on boasting about myself. Although I do not think that my telling you about this will help you to accept me as Christâ€™s representative to you, I will say this anyway. I will tell you about visions that the Lord gave a certain man and about things that he supernaturally revealed to that man. I will tell you this because some of the people among you boast that it was in visions that they received the things that they teach."}

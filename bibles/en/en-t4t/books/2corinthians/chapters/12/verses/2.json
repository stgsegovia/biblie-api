{"verse":"2","text":"The man that I will tell you about is one who believes in Christ. Fourteen years ago he was taken {Christ took him} up into the third heaven, the highest heaven, the place where God is. I do not know whether he went there in his physical body or whether he was outside of his body at that time and only his spirit went. Only God really knows."}

{"verse":"7","text":"You are doing very well in so many other ways. God’s Spirit enables you to believe that God will do miracles. His Spirit has given you the ability to tell God’s message to others. His Spirit makes you able to know things that he reveals to you. You eagerly want to help people, and you love us (exc) very much. So now, try to also do well in getting your generous gift of money [EUP] ready to send to the believers in Judea province."}

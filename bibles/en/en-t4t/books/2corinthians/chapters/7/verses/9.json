{"verse":"9","text":"So now I am happy that I wrote it. I am not happy that you were distressed {that I distressed you}, but I am happy because, when you became distressed, you felt sorry for what you had done and you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you felt sorry in the way that God wanted you to feel sorry, so my making you feel sorry did not harm you at all."}

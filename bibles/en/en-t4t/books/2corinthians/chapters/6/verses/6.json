{"verse":"6","text":"All that we think about and all that we do is pure in Godâ€™s sight. Knowing how God wants us to conduct our lives, we do what pleases him. We are patient with those who oppose us. We are kind to everyone. We depend on the Holy Spirit to help us. We love people sincerely as God wants us to love them."}

{"verse":"11","text":"It makes me fearful to think that some day I will stand before the Lord for him to judge me. So I do everything that I can to convince people that they should believe (OR, that I teach sincerely) Godâ€™s message. God knows very well how I conduct my life and what I teach, and I really believe that you know it, too."}

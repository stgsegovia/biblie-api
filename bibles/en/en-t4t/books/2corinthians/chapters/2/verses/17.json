{"verse":"17","text":"But perhaps God considers us(exc) able, because we do not work/act like so many others whom you know. They teach Godâ€™s message in a way that they think people will like, and they think that people will pay them for teaching that way. We (exc) certainly do not do that. On the contrary, as servants of Christ, and knowing that God is watching us (exc), we teach sincerely the message that God sent us to proclaim."}

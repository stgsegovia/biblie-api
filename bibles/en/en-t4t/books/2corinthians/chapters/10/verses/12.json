{"verse":"12","text":"Those who oppose me tell others how good they are. If they really were superior to me [IRO], I would not be so bold as to say that I was equal to them, or to compare myself with them. But they are not superior to me. They make up their own standards about what Godâ€™s servants should be like, and then they look at their own conduct and decide whether or not they meet those standards. By doing that, they show that they are foolish."}

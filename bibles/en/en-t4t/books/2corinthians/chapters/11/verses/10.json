{"verse":"10","text":"And as sure as you know that everything that Christ says is true, you can be sure that what I say to you now is true. Wherever I go there in Achaia province, I do not let you believers pay me for doing Godâ€™s work among you. And no one will be able to prevent me from boasting about that."}

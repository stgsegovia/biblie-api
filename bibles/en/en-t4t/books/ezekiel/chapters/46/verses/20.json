{"verse":"20","text":"He said to me, “This is the place where the priests must cook the meat of the offerings that people bring in order to no longer be guilty for having sinned, and offerings for their sins, and where they will bake bread made with the flour brought to be offerings. They will cook those things in their rooms  in order to avoid bringing them into the outer courtyard to cook them there, lest someone be punished because of touching them.”"}

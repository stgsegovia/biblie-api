{"verse":"2","text":"The king must enter the courtyard through the entry room of the entryway, and stand alongside the entry post. Then the priests must sacrifice the animal that the king brought to be completely burnedon the altar, and also his offering to maintain fellowship with me. The king must worship me at the entrance of the entryway, and then he must go out. After he leaves, the entryway will not be shut until that evening."}

{"verse":"9","text":"When that happens, in those nations to which they have been forced to go, those who have escaped from being killed will think about me. They will remember that I was very grieved because of their turning away from me [IDM] with their inner beings, and because they very much desired [IDM] to worship their idols. They will ◄hate/be very displeased with► themselves because of the evil and detestable things that they have done."}

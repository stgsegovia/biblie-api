{"verse":"20","text":"Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, sayto those women: â€œI detest your magic charms by which you deceive people like [SIM] people trap birds. I will tear those charms off your wrists, and I will cause the people whom you have deceived to no longer be deceived by you."}

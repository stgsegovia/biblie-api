{"verse":"18","text":"Tell them, â€œThis is what Yahweh the Lord says: Terrible things will happen to you women who fasten magic charms on your wrists and make veils of various sizes to put on your heads in order to deceive the people. You think that [RHQ] you will deceive othersby telling them that you know what will happen in the future, and that you will save your own lives."}

{"verse":"3","text":"He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up high above the earth, and in visions God took me from Babylon to Jerusalem. He took me to the temple, to the north gate, to the place where there was an idol that caused Yahweh to be very disgusted and furious."}

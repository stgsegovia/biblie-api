{"verse":"47","text":"Say to the forest in the southpart of Israel: 'Listen to this message that Yahweh the Lord is saying about you: â€œI am about to start a fire in your midst, and it will burn up all your trees, both the green trees and the withered/dry trees. Nothing will extinguish the blazing flames. And the fire will scorch the faces of everyone who lives in that area, from the south to the north."}

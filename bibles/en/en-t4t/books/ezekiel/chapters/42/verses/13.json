{"verse":"13","text":"Then the man said to me, â€œThese rooms that overlook the temple on the north and south sides are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to Yahweh will eattheir portions of the sacred offerings. Because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings: the grain for the grain offerings, the offerings for the sins that people have committed, and offerings in order that people will no longer be guilty for having sinned."}

{"verse":"22","text":"Therefore, say to the Israeli people, â€˜This is what Yahweh the Lord says: You Israeli people, it is not for your sake that I am going to do these things. Instead, it is for the sake of my sacred reputation, which you have disgraced among the nations to which you were forced to go."}

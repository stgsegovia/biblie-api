{"verse":"29","text":"They will eat the offerings other people make from grain, offerings to remove peopleâ€™s guilt for having sinned, and offerings made when people fail to give to Yahweh the things that they are required to give. Everything else in Israel that is completely dedicated to me, Yahweh, will belong to the priests."}

{"verse":"30","text":"All the rulers of countries north of Israel, including people from Sidon, will be there. Because of their power, they caused people to be terrified, but they will lie there. They were godless, and they will lie there along with others who were killed by their enemiesâ€™ swords. They, along with everyone else who descends into that deep pit, will be disgraced."}

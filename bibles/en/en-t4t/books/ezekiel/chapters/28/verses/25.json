{"verse":"25","text":"And this is also what Yahweh the Lord says: â€œSome day the people of Israel will live in their own land again, the land that I gave to Jacob, who also served me. I will gather them from distant countries where I have scattered them. And I will reveal to the nations that I am holy among my people."}

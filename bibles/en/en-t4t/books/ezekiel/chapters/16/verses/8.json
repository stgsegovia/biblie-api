{"verse":"8","text":"When I saw you several years later, it was as though [MET] I saw that you were old enough to have sex [EUP]. So it was as though [MET] I spread the corner of my robe over youto symbolize that I would marry you, with the result that you were no longer naked. I solemnly promised that I would marry you and made a marriage agreement with you, and you became my wife. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say."}

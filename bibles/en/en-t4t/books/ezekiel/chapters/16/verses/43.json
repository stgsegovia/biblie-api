{"verse":"43","text":"You have forgotten the wonderful things that I did for you in previous years [MET]. You have caused me to become extremely angry because of all the evil things that you have done. In addition to all the other detestable things that you did, you committed many sexual sins. So I, Yahweh the Lord, declare that I will punish you [IDM] for doing those things."}

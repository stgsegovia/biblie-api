{"verse":"36","text":"I say that what you have done is as though [MET] you took off your clothes and acted like a prostitute and had sex with men who are not your husband. What I mean is that you have been worshiping detestable idols, and you have murdered [MTY] your own children to be sacrifices to them."}

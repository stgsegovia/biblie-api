{"verse":"9","text":"Then after you have told that to the people, say to them, â€˜This is what Yahweh the Lord says: That vine will certainly not [RHQ] remain healthy/productive. It will be [RHQ] pulled up by its roots by the eagle that planted it, and all its fruit will be stripped off and its leaves will wither. And it will not need someone with strong arms or many people to pull it out by its roots."}

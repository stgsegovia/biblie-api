{"verse":"10","text":"I am opposed to you leaders who should be like [MET] shepherds for my people. I will remove you from taking care of my people, with the result that you will no longer feed yourselves instead of feeding them. I will rescue my people from you, with the result that you will longer be able to butcher them and eat them."}

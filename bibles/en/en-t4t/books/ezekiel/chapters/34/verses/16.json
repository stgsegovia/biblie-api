{"verse":"16","text":"I will search for those who are lost and bring back the ones who have strayed away. I will bandage those who have been injured and strengthen those who are weak. But I will get rid of those who are fat and powerful. I will act fairly toward the people who are like [MET] my sheep. That is what I, Yahweh, promise."}

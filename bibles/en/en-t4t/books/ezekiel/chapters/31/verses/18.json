{"verse":"18","text":"This parable is about you people of Egypt. You think that [RHQ, IRO] there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is. But your nation will also be destroyed, as Assyria was, along with those other nations. Your people will be there among the other people who are not fit to worship me, people who have been killed by their enemies’ swords. That is what will happen to the king of Egypt and all his people. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have predicted it.’ ”"}

{"verse":"15","text":"This is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: â€˜When that great tree was cut down, it was as though the springs that watered it mourned for it, because I caused the plentiful water from the springs to dry up. I caused the mountains in Lebanon to become black, and all the trees there to wither."}

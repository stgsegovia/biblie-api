{"verse":"14","text":"The Israeli people will use their power [MTY] to get revenge on the people of Edom. They will show the people of Edom that I have been angry with them, and I will punish [MTY] them. The people of Edom will experience my getting revenge on them. Then they will know that I, Yahweh the Lord, have the power to do what I say that I will do.‚Äù"}

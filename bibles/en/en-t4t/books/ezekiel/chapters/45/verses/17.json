{"verse":"17","text":"The king must provide the animals to be completely burned on the altar, grain for the grain offerings, and wine for the wine offerings for the sacred festivals that I have appointed for the people of Israelâ€”including the festivals to celebrate each new moon and the Sabbaths. He must provide the animals for the offerings for the people to become acceptable to me, grain for the grain offerings, animals to be completely burned on the altar, and offerings to maintain fellowship with me, Yahweh, in order that I will forgive the Israeli people for their sins."}

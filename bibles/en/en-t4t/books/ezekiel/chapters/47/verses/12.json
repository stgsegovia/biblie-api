{"verse":"12","text":"Many kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and they will always have fruit. They will bear fruit every month, because they will continually get water from the water that comes  from the temple. Their fruit will be good to eat and their leaves will be good for healing.‚Äù"}

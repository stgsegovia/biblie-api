{"verse":"10","text":"It was fitting that God make Jesus ◄perfect/all that God intended him to be►. God was enabling many people who would belong to him [MET] to share his glory. God is the one who created all things, and he is the one for whom all things exist. He perfected Jesus by causing him to suffer and die. Jesus is the one whom God uses to save people."}

{"verse":"20","text":"Jesus enabled us to go into God’s presence by making a new and effective way. Specifically, he offered his body as a sacrifice for us in order that nothing would stop us from entering God’s presence, just like [MET] the curtain of the very holy place prevented people from entering God’s presence."}

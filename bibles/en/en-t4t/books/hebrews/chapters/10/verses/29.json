{"verse":"29","text":"That was severe punishment. But Christ is ◄God’s Son/the man who is also God►. His blood, by means of which he put into effect the new covenant, is sacred. Because of Christ’s [MTY] blood flowing for us when he died, God freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure [RHQ] that anyone who shows contempt for those truths and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve, deserves to be punished even worse than those Israelis were punished [MET]!"}

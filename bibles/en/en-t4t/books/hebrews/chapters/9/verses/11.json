{"verse":"11","text":"But when Christ came as our Supreme Priest, he brought the good things that are now available. When he appeared, he went into Godâ€™s presence in heaven. That is like a [MET] very great and perfect tent not made by humans {which no human made} [SYN]; that is, it is not part of the world God created. It was better than the tent Moses set up here on earth."}

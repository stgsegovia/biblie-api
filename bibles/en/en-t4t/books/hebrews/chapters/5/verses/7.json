{"verse":"7","text":"When Christ lived on the earth [MTY], he prayed [DOU] to God and tearfully cried out loudly to him. Specifically, he asked God, who was able to help him, that he would not fear the sufferings just before he died. As a result, God listened to him, because Christ reverently submitted to what God wanted him to do."}

{"verse":"9","text":"It was because Abraham trusted God that he lived as though he was a foreigner in the land that God had promised to him. Abraham lived in tents, and his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob did also. God promised to give to Isaac and Jacob the same things that he promised to give Abraham."}

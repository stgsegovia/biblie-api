{"verse":"35","text":"Some women who trusted God received their relatives back again when God ◄made them live again after they had died/raised them from the dead►. But others who trusted God were tortured until they died. They were tortured because they refused to agree when their captors said, “We will release you if you deny that you believe in God.” They refused to do that, because they wanted to live with God forever, which is better than continuing to live on earth after having almost died."}

{"verse":"13","text":"It was while they still trusted in God that all those people died. Even though they had not yet received the things that God had promised to give them, it was as though they saw those things in a distance. They were glad to know about what God promised. It was as though they admitted that they were not from this earth, but that they were only here temporarily."}

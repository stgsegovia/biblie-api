{"verse":"17","text":"Obey your spiritual leaders; do what they tell you, since they are the ones who are looking out for your spiritual welfare [SYN]. Some day they will have to stand before God so that he can say if he approves of what they have done. Obey them in order that they can do the work of guarding you joyfully, and not have to do it sadly, because if you cause them to do it sadly, that will certainly not help you at all (OR, they will not be able to help you at all)."}

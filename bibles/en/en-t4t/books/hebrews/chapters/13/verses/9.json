{"verse":"9","text":"So, do not let yourselves be diverted {let anything divert you} so that you believe various teachings that are contrary to Godâ€™s truth. It is good that God acts kindly toward us so that we may be strengthened spiritually. Obeying rules about various foods, rules that have not benefited those who obeyed them, will not benefit us."}

{"verse":"6","text":"But Christ faithfully serves God as he ◄helps/cares for► his own people [MTY, MET], just like a son helps/cares for his own family. And we are God’s people [MTY] if we continue to confidently believe in Christ and if we continue to confidently wait for what God will do for us."}

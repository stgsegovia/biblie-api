They are like a crowd of spectators who are cheering for us inside a stadium [MET]. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us, as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are heavy [MET]. Especially we must put away sinful actions that hinder us, as a runner sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him [MET]. Let us wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as someone in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him [MET]."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"2","text":"And let us keep our minds on Jesus, as a runner keeps his eyes on the goal [MET]. Jesus is the one we should imitate in the way he perfectly trusted God. When he died on the cross he endured it as he suffered greatly [MTY], instead of thinking about the things he would rejoice about later. He disregarded being disgraced by dying that way. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor [MTY] at the throne where God rules."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"3","text":"Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Try to act the way he did, so that you do not give up trusting God or become discouraged."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"4","text":"While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"5","text":"Do not forget [RHQ] these words that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as God would exhort you as his children:"},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"6","text":"because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,"},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"7","text":"It is in order that God may discipline you that he requires you to endure the disagreeable things that happen to you. When God disciplines you he is treating you as a father treats his children.

You are like illegitimate children; no father disciplines them."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"12","verse":"9","text":"Furthermore, our natural fathers disciplined us when we were young, and we respected them for doing that.

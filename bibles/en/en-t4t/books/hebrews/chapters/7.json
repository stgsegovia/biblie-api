Melchizedek asked God to bless Abraham."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"2","text":"Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all the spoils he took after winning the battle. Melchizedek’s name means firstly ‘king who rules righteously’, and since Salem means ‘peace’, he was the ‘king who rules peacefully’."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"3","text":"In the Scriptures there is no record of who his father was, nor is there any record of who his mother was, nor is there any record of who his ancestors were. There is no record of when he was born, nor is there any record of when he died. For these reasons, it is as though he continues to be a priest forever, and for this reason he is like God’s Son."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"4","text":"You can realize how great this man Melchizedek was from the fact that Abraham, our famous ancestor, gave him ◄a tithe/one tenth► of the spoils from the battle."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"5","text":"According to the laws God gave Moses, the descendants of Abraham’s great-grandson Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from God’s people who were their relatives, even though those people also were Abraham’s descendants."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"6","text":"But this man Melchizedek, who was not among the descendants of Levi, took tithes from Abraham.

And Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we conclude that Melchizedek was greater than Abraham."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"8","text":"In the case of the priests who are descendants of Levi, men who some day will die receive tithes. But in the case of Melchizedek it is as if God testifies that he was still living, since there is no record in Scriptures about his death."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"9","text":"And it was as though Levi himself, and all the priests descended from him—who received tithes from the people—paid tithes to Melchizedek. And when Abraham paid tithes, it was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him acknowledged that the work Melchizedek did as a priest was greater than the work Levi did,"},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"10","text":"since the sperm from which all those priests were eventually born was still in Abraham’s body [EUP] when Melchizedek met Abraham."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"11","text":"God gave his laws to his people at the same time he gave regulations about the priests. So, if what the priests who were descended from Levi did could have provided a way for God to completely forgive people for disobeying those laws, certainly no other priest like Melchizedek would have been necessary. [RHQ] Instead, priests who were descended from Aaron, Levi’s descendant, would have been adequate."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"12","text":"But we know they were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has come.

On the other hand, God caused that we could confidently expect better things than we could expect by obeying God’s laws. He did that by his establishing Christ as priest. Now by means of Christ sacrificing himself for us we can come near to God."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"20","text":"Furthermore, when God appointed Christ, it was when God solemnly declared that Christ would be a priest [LIT].

They do this, firstly, to atone for their own sins, and then to atone for other people who have sinned. But because Jesus never sinned, he does not need to atone for his own sin. The only thing he needed to do to save people was to sacrifice himself once!"},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"28","text":"We need a Supreme Priest like him, because in the laws that God gave Moses [PRS] the ones who would be appointed to be priests would be men who tended to sin easily.

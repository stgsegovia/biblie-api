{"verse":"23","text":"You have joined all the believers who have privileges like firstborn sons, whose names God has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone. You have come to where the spirits of Godâ€™s people are, people who lived righteously before they died, and who now have been made perfect in heaven."}

{"verse":"15","text":"Beware that none of you stops trusting in God, who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve (OR, Beware that you have never experienced God kindly saving you). Be on guard lest any of you act in an evil way towards others, because your doing that will grow like [MET] a root grows into a big plant, and the result of your doing that will be that many believers will sin and become unacceptable to God."}

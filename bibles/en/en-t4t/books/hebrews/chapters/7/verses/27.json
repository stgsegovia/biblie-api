{"verse":"27","text":"The other Supreme Priests need to sacrifice animals day by day as well as year by year. They do this, firstly, to atone for their own sins, and then to atone for other people who have sinned. But because Jesus never sinned, he does not need to atone for his own sin. The only thing he needed to do to save people was to sacrifice himself once!"}

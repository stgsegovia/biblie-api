{"verse":"28","text":"We need a Supreme Priest like him, because in the laws that God gave Moses [PRS] the ones who would be appointed to be priests would be men who tended to sin easily. But God solemnly declared [PRS] after he had given his laws to Moses that he would appoint ◄his Son/the man who is also God► to be a Supreme Priest. Now ◄his Son/the man who is also God► has forever become all that God intends him to be."}

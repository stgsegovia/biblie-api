{"verse":"19","text":"Remember that no one was able to become all that God intended by obeying the laws that God gave Moses. On the other hand, God caused that we could confidently expect better things than we could expect by obeying Godâ€™s laws. He did that by his establishing Christ as priest. Now by means of Christ sacrificing himself for us we can come near to God."}

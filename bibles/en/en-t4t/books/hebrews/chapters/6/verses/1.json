{"verse":"1","text":"So, we (inc) must not keep discussing the elementary principles about Christ. Instead, we must proceed to the teaching that will make us spiritually mature [MTY]. We must not be people who always need someone to teach them the elementary truths about Christ that are like [MET] a foundation. I am referring to the teaching that people who do sinful things must turn away from their sinful behavior, things that those who are spiritually [MET] dead do. I am referring to the teaching that people must believe in God."}

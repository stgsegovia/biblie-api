{"verse":"11","text":"Those who speak to the congregation should do that as though they are speaking the very words of God. Those who do kind things to others should do it with the strength that God gives them, in order that God may be honored by all this {that all this may honor God} as Jesus Christ enables us to do it. I pray that we will praise God (OR, Jesus) and allow him to rule over us forever. ◄May it be so!/Amen!►"}

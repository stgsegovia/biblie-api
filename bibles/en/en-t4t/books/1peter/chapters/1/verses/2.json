{"verse":"2","text":"God our Father previously chose you, and his Spirit has set you apart in order that you would obey Jesus Christ. He did that in order that just like Moses sprinkled the Israelites with blood when God established the old covenant [MET], Jesus would establish his new covenant with you with the blood that flowed from his body when he died. May God act very kindly to you, and may he give you much inner peace."}

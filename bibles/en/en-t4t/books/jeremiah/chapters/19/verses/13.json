{"verse":"13","text":"The houses in Jerusalem and the palaces of the kings of Judah will be desecrated like this place will be. All the houses where you burned incense on the rooftops to honor the stars that you worshiped, and where you poured out wine to be an offering to your gods, will become ◄desecrated/unacceptable places for people to worship me►.”’”"}

{"verse":"4","text":"This is what I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israeli people say you belong to, say: ‘The men in this city have torn down some of their houses, and even parts of the king’s palace, to get materials to strengthen the walls around the city, in order that the soldiers of Babylonia will not be able to break through the walls after they climb up the ramps that they have built against the walls, and kill the inhabitants with their swords."}

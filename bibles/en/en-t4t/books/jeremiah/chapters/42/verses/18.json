{"verse":"18","text":"And the Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelis worship, also says this: ‘Because I was very angry, I severely punished [MTY] all the people of Jerusalem. I will do the same things to you when you go to Egypt. The result will be that people will curse you. They will be horrified about what has happened to you. They will make fun of you, and you will never see this land again.’"}

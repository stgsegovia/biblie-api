{"verse":"4","text":"And I will also cause King Jehoiachin to be brought back here, and all the other people who were captured and taken to Babylon. The king of Babylon has forced you to do what he wants, like someone puts a yoke on the neck of an ox to force it to do what he wants [MET] it to do. But I will cause that to end. That will happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.’ ”"}

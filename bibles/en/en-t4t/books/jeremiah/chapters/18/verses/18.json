{"verse":"18","text":"Then some of the people said, “Come, let’s plan to attack Jeremiah. We have many priests who teach us God’s laws, and wise men who give us good advice, and prophets who tell us what will happen. We do not need Jeremiah! So, let’s slander him and not pay attention to anything that he says.”"}

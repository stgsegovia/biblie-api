{"verse":"10","text":"Baruch read to all the people the messages that he had written on the scroll. He read them while he was in the temple, in the room where Gemariah stayed. He was the son of Shaphan, who had previously been the kingâ€™s secretary. That room was close to the upper courtyard of the temple, near the entrance to the temple that is called the New Gate."}

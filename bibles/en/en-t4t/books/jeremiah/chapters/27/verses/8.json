{"verse":"8","text":"But now I tell you that you must do what the king of Babylon wants you to do [MET], like an ox that has a yoke on its neck must do what its master wants it to do. I will punish any nation that refuses to do that. I will cause those people to experience war and famine and diseases, until the armies of Babylon have conquered that nation."}

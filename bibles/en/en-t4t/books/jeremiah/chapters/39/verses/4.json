{"verse":"4","text":"When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers realized that the army of Babylonia had broken into the city, they fled. They waited until it was dark. Then they went out of the city through the kingâ€™s garden, through the gate that was between the two walls. Then they started running toward the Jordan River Valley."}

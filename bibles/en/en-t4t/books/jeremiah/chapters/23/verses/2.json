{"verse":"2","text":"So, this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people worship, say to those leaders: â€˜Instead of taking care of my people and leading them to places where they are safe, like a shepherd does for his sheep, you have scattered them. So I will punish you for the evil things that you have done."}

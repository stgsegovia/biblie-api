{"verse":"32","text":"I oppose those prophets who falsely say that I told them something in a vision, but they are only telling lies that cause my people to sin. I did not send those prophets. I did not even appoint them to be prophets. And they have no messages that will benefit my people at all.' That is what I, Yahweh, declare.‚Äù"}

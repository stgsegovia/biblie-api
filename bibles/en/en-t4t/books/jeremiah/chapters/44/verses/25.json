{"verse":"25","text":"This is what the Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelis worship, says to you Israeli men: ‘You and your wives have said that you would continue to do what you promised, to burn incense and pour out wine to the goddess whom you call the Queen of Heaven. And you have proved by your actions that you intend to continue to do that. So go ahead and continue doing what you have promised to do for her.’"}

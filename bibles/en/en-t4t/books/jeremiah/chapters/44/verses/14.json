{"verse":"14","text":"You people who did not die in Judah fled here to Egypt, hoping that some day you would return to Judah. But very few [HYP] of you will survive and escape. You are longing/wanting to remain alive and return to Judah, but only a very few of you will escape and be able to do that.’ ”"}

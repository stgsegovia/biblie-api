{"verse":"12","text":"You people from Judah who have survived were determined to come and live here in Egypt. So I will get rid of all of you here in Egypt. Every one of you will die, including those who are important and those who are not important. Some of you will be killed by your enemiesâ€™ swords, some will die from famines. You will become people whom others curse, be horrified about, and make fun of."}

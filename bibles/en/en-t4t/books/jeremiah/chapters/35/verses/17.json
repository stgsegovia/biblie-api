{"verse":"17","text":"Therefore, this is what I, the Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israeli people say you belong to, say: 'You have refused to listen to me and you did not answer when I called you. Therefore, I will cause the people in Jerusalem and other places in Judah to experience all the disasters that I said that I would cause to happen.' ” ' ”"}

{"verse":"4","text":"I took them to the temple, and we went into the room where the sons of Igdaliahâ€™s son Hanan, who was a prophet, stayed. That room was next to the room that was used by the men who were in charge of the entrances to the temple. It was above the room that belonged to Maaseiah, who was the temple gatekeeper and the son of Shallum."}

{"verse":"14","text":"Yahweh replied to me, â€œThose prophets say that they are speaking what I tell them to say [MTY], but they are telling lies. I did not send them, so what they are saying is false. They say that they have received visions from me, and that they are telling things that I have revealed to them, but that is not true. They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves."}

{"verse":"12","text":"When they ◄fast/abstain from food in order to honor me►, I will not pay any attention. When they bring to me their offerings of animals to be completely burned on the altar and their offerings of grain, I will not accept them. Instead, I will get rid of them by wars, by famines, and by diseases.”"}

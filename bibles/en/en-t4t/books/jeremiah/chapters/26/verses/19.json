{"verse":"19","text":"But did [RHQ] King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah for saying that? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would ◄act mercifully toward/not destroy► them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about causing them to experience the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now if we kill Jeremiah, we are going to cause ourselves to experience a terrible disaster!”"}

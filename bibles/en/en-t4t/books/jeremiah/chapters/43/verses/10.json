{"verse":"10","text":"Then say to the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis say you belong to, says: “I will summon Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon, who does my work, to come with his army to Egypt. I will set up his throne over these stones that I told Jeremiah to bury. And Nebuchadnezzar will set up his tent there to show that he has become the King of Egypt."}

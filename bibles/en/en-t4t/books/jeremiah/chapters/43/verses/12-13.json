{"verse":"12-13","text":"Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. But before they burn the temples, they will take away their idols as souvenirs. His troops will clean Egypt like a shepherd cleans lice from his cloak. They will tear down the sacred pillars that are in the temple of their sun god. And then Nebuchadnezzar’s troops will leave there, without having been harmed.” ’ ”"}

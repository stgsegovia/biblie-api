{"verse":"34","text":"And it will not be necessary for them to teach their neighbors or their relatives and say, “You need to know Yahweh,” because everyone, including unimportant people and very important people, will already know me. And I will forgive them for having been very wicked, and I will never think again about the sins that they have committed.’ ”"}

{"verse":"10","text":"Those who are God’s children are clearly different from those who are ◄the devil’s/Satan’s► children. The way that we can know who are Satan’s children is this: Those who do not do what is right are not God’s children. Specifically, those who do not love their fellow believers are not God’s children Instead, they are Satan’s children."}

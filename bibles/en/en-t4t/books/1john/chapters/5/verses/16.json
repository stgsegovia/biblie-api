{"verse":"16","text":"Those who see one of their fellow believers sinning in a way that does not result in being eternally separated from God should ask God to help that fellow believer; and as a result God  will help that fellow believer and enable him or her to live eternally. But some people  sin in a manner that causes them  to be separated from God eternally. I am not saying that you should  ask God to help  people who sin like that."}

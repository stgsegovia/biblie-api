{"verse":"22","text":"The worst liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is ◄the Messiah/the one whom God chose to rescue us►. They are the ones that we told you about, the ones who oppose Christ. They refuse to acknowledge/admit that God is the Father and that Jesus is his Son (OR, the one who is also God)."}

{"verse":"6","text":"I heard a voice that sounded like it was coming from among the four living creatures. It was saying ◄to the horseman/to the man who was sitting on the black horse►, “A quart of wheat will cost so much that a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it, and three quarts of barley will sell for the same price. But do not cut off the supply of olive oil or the wine [MTY]!”"}

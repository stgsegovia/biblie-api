{"verse":"8","text":"This time I saw a pale horse come out. The one who sat on it is named ‘The one who causes death [PRS]’, and the one that is named ‘The place where dead people go’ accompanied him. God gave them authority over one quarter of the people on earth to incite them to kill each other with weapons [SYN], and also authority to kill them ◄by causing them to starve, by their causing them to become sick from epidemics, and by their causing them to be attacked by wild animals."}

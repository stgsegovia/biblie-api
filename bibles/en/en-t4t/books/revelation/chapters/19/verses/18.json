{"verse":"18","text":"Come and eat the flesh of all God’s enemies who are dead— the flesh of kings, army commanders, people who fought powerfully, horses and the soldiers who rode them, and the flesh of all other kinds of people, whether they were free or slaves, socially insignificant or significant. All kinds!”"}

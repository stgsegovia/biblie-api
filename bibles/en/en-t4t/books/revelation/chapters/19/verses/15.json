{"verse":"15","text":"The words that Jesus speaks are like [MTY] a sharp sword with which he will strike the rebellious people of the nations. He himself will rule them powerfully, as though he had [MET] an iron rod. He will crush his enemies just like [MET] a person crushes grapes in a winepress. He will do this for God Almighty, who is extremely angry with them because of their sins."}

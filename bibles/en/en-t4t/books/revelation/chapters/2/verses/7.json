{"verse":"7","text":"Everyone who wants to understand my message [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God’s Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who overcomes Satan, I will give the right to eat fruit [MTY] from the tree that gives eternal life, the tree that is in God’s garden.’”"}

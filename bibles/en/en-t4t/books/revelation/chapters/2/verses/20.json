{"verse":"20","text":"Nevertheless, I have this complaint about you: You tolerate that woman among your members who is like [MET] that wicked queen Jezebel who lived long ago. She says that she ◄is a prophetess/proclaims messages that come directly from God►, but through what she teaches she is deceiving my servants. She is urging them to commit sexual immorality and to eat food that they have offered to idols."}

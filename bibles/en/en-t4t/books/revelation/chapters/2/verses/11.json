{"verse":"11","text":"Everyone who wants to understand [MTY] must listen carefully to the message that God’s Spirit speaks to the congregations. After those who conquer Satan die, they will live with God. They will never suffer again, even though many others will suffer as though they died a second time.’ ”"}

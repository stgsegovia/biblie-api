{"verse":"10","text":"Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to put some of you in prison, to tempt you to deny that you believe in me. For a short period of time you will suffer because of what people will do to you [MTY]. Continue to trust in me, even if they kill you because you trust in me. As a result, I will reward you with eternal life, just like [MET] people reward a victorious athlete by putting a wreath on his head."}

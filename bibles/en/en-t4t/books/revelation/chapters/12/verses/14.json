{"verse":"14","text":"But the woman was given two wings like the wings of a very large eagle, in order that she might fly to a desolate place. That is a place that God has prepared for her. There she was taken care of {Godâ€™s angels took care of her} for three and a half years. The serpent, that is, the dragon, was not able to reach her there."}

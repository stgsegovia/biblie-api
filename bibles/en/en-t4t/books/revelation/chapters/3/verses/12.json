{"verse":"12","text":"I will make everyone who conquers Satan secure. They will stand in the temple of my God, they will stand firm like [MET] pillars, and they will remain there forever. I will mark them with the name of my God, showing that they belong to him. I will also mark them with the name of the city of my God, showing that they will live there. That city is the New Jerusalem, the city that my God will cause to descend down from heaven. I will also mark them with my new name, showing that they belong to me."}

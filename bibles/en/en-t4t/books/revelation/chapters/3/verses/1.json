I am the one who can give to people all the power of God’s Spirit (OR, in whom is the Spirit of God who has all kinds of power; OR, who has God’s Spirit, who is symbolized as seven spirits), and I am the one who has the seven stars. I know everything that you have done. You (pl) appear to be alive spiritually, but you are so weak spiritually it is as though you are dead [MET]."}

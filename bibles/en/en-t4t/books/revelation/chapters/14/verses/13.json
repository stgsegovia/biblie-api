{"verse":"13","text":"I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: God will now abundantly bless the people who have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus for the rest of their lives.” God’s Spirit says, “Yes, after they die, they will no longer have to work hard. Instead, they will rest, and the record of the good deeds [MTY] that they have done will go with them (OR, God will reward them for the good deeds that they have done).”"}

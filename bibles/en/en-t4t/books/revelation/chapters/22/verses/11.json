{"verse":"11","text":"Since that time is near, if those who act in an evil manner want to continue to act that way [IRO], that is up to them. God will soon ◄pay them back/punish them► for that. If those who are vile want to continue to be vile [IRO], that is up to them. God will soon ◄pay them back/punish them► for that. Those who are acting righteously should continue to act righteously. And those who are holy should continue to be holy.”"}

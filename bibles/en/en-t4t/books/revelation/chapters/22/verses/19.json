{"verse":"19","text":"If anyone omits any of the message about what I have foretold in this book, God will take away that person’s right to eat fruit from [MTY] the tree that enables people to live forever. He will also take away that person’s right to enter God’s city. Both these things are described {I have described both these things} in this book.”"}

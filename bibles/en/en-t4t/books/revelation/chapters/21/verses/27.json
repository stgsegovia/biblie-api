{"verse":"27","text":"No one who is morally impure, no one who does things that God considers detestable, and no one who tells lies, will ever enter that city. Only those people whose names are written in the book of the one who is like a lamb {whose names the one who is like a lamb has written in his book}, the names of people who have eternal life, will be there."}

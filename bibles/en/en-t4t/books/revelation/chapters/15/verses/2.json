{"verse":"2","text":"I saw what looked like an ocean that was made of glass and mixed with fire. And I saw the people who overcame the beast by not worshipping it or its image, or allowing its agent to mark them with the number that corresponds to the beastâ€™s name [PRS]. They were standing by the ocean that looked like it was made of glass. They had harps for praising God."}

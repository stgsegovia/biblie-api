{"verse":"8","text":"He will go out to deceive rebellious people in nations [IDM] all over the earth. These are the nations that the prophet Ezekiel called Gog and Magog. Satan will gather them to fight against God’s people. There will be so many of them fighting against God’s people that no one will be able to count them [SIM], just like no one can count the grains of sand on the ocean shore."}

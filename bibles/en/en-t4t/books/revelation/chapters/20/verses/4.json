{"verse":"4","text":"I saw thrones on which people were sitting. They were given {God gave those people} authority to judge other people. I also saw the souls of people whose heads had been {whose heads others had} cut off because of their telling people about Jesus and declaring God’s message. They were people who refused to worship the beast or its image, and who did not allow the beast’s agents to put the beast’s mark on them, either on their foreheads or on their hands. They became alive again, and they ruled with Christ during those 1,000 years."}

{"verse":"10","text":"The devil, who had deceived those people, will be thrown {Godâ€™s angel will throw the devil, who had deceived those people} into the lake of burning sulfur. This is the same lake into which both the beast and the false prophet had been thrown {he had thrown both the beast and the false prophet}. As a result, they will continually suffer severely forever."}

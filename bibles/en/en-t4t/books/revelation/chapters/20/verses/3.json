{"verse":"3","text":"The angel threw him into the deep dark pit. He shut the door of the pit, locked it, and sealed it to prevent anyone from opening it. He did that in order that Satan might no longer deceive the people of the nations [MTY], until those 1,000 years are ended. After that time, Satan must be released {God/Godâ€™s angel must release Satan} for a short time in order that he can do what God has planned."}

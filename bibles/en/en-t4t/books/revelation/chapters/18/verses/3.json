{"verse":"3","text":"God will destroy those cities because their rulers have persuaded the people of [MTY] all nations to act very immorally and idolatrously with the people of [MET] those cities, just like a prostitute persuades men to drink strong wine and then commit fornication with her. The rulers of the earth have also acted immorally and idolatrously with the people of [MTY] those cities. The merchants of the earth have become rich because the people of those cities strongly desired and bought from the merchants many ◄luxuries/expensive things►.”"}

{"verse":"5","text":"Listen to me, my fellow believers whom I love: God has chosen [RHQ] poor people whom unbelievers consider to possess nothing of value, so that he might bless them greatly because they trust in him, and in order that they will enter the place where he will rule [MET] forever. That is what he has promised to those who love him."}

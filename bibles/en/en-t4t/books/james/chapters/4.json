You desire what other people have, but you are unable to get what you desire, so you quarrel and fight with one another [HYP]. You do not have what you desire because you do not ask God for it."},{"book":"James","chapter":"4","verse":"3","text":"And even when you do ask him, he does not give you what you ask for because you are asking for the wrong reason.

In this law, God commanded [MTY] us to love others, and those who say evil things about fellow believers, it is as though they are saying that we do not have to do what God commanded.

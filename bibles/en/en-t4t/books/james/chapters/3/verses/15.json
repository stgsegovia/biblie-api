{"verse":"15","text":"Those who have such attitudes are not wise [MTY] in the way that God wants them to be. Instead, they are only thinking and acting like ◄ungodly people/people who do not please God►. They think and act according to their own evil desires. They do what the demons want them to do (OR, they think and act as demons do)."}

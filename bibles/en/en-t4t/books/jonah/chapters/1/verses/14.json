{"verse":"14","text":"Therefore they prayed to Yahweh, and one of them prayed, “O Yahweh, please do not let us drown because of our causing this man to die. O Yahweh, you have done what you wanted to do. We do not know if this man has sinned. If he has not sinned, do not consider that we are guilty of sinning when we cause him to die!”"}

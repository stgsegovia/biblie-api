{"verse":"6","text":"Then the captain went down to where Jonah was sleeping soundly. He awoke him and said to him, “◄How can you sleep during a storm like this?/You should not be sleeping during a storm like this► [RHQ]! Get up and pray to your god! Perhaps he will pity us and save us, in order that we will not drown!” But Jonah refused to do that."}

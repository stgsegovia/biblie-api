He went down to Joppa city. There he bought a ticket to travel on a ship that was going to Tarshish city, in order to avoid doing what Yahweh told him to do. He got on the ship, and then went down to a lower deck, lay down, and went to sleep."},{"book":"Jonah","chapter":"1","verse":"4","text":"Then Yahweh caused a very strong wind to blow, and there was such a violent storm that the sailors thought the ship would break apart."},{"book":"Jonah","chapter":"1","verse":"5","text":"The sailors were very frightened.

{"verse":"7","text":"Joshua and the Israeli army also defeated kings who ruled over the land on the west side of the Jordan River. He gave that land to the Israeli people, dividing it among the other tribes. That land was between Baal-Gad city in the Lebanon Valley in the far north all the way south to Halak Mountain, which is near the land of the Edom people-group."}

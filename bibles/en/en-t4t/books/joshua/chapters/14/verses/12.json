{"verse":"12","text":"So please give me the hilly area that Yahweh promised to give to me at that time long ago. At that time, you heard me say that the Amalek people-group lived there. You heard me say that their cities were large, and they had walls around them to protect them from attacks by their enemies. But now, Yahweh will help me, and as a result I will force them to leave, just like Yahweh said would happen.‚Äù"}

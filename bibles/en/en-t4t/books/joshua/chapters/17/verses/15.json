{"verse":"15","text":"Joshua replied to them, “I agree that you do not have enough land in the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim. So, since you have a lot of people, I will allot more land to you, in the hilly region. But you will have to cut down the trees in the forest and  make a place for yourselves in the land where the Periz and Repha people-groups live.”"}

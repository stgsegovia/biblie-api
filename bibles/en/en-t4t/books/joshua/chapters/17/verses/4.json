{"verse":"4","text":"They went to Eleazar the Supreme Priest, and to Joshua and to the other Israeli leaders. They said, “We want you to give us some land, because Yahweh told Moses that he should give to us some land, just like you gave to the men.” So Eleazar did what Yahweh had commanded, and he allotted to them some land, just like he allotted to their uncles."}

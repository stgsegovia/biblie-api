{"verse":"16","text":"“Gather together all the Jews here in Susa, and tell them to ◄fast/abstain from food► for my sake. Tell them to not eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will also fast. Then, I will go to talk to the king. Even if ◄I am executed/they execute me► for disobeying the law by seeing him when he does not hold out the scepter/staff toward me, I am willing for that to happen”."}

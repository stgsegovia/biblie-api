{"verse":"11","text":"“There is a law about people going to talk to the king. All the king’s officials and all the people in the empire know this law. In that law it states that anyone who goes to the king in his inner court without having been summoned by the king must be executed. Only those to whom the king has extended his scepter/staff will not be executed. And a month has passed since the king has summoned me, so what will happen to me if I try to see him and he doesn’t want to see me?”"}

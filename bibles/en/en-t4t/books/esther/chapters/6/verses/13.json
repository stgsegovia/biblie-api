{"verse":"13","text":"He told his wife Zeresh and his friends everything that had happened to him that day. Then his wife and his friends said to him, “Mordecai, the man who has caused you to be completely disgraced/humiliated, is a Jew. It is clear that the God whom the Jews worship is fighting for them. So you will never be able to defeat Mordecai. He will defeat you!”"}

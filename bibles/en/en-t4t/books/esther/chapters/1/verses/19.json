{"verse":"19","text":"So if it pleases you, O king, you should write a law. Like all the other laws of Persia and Media, it will be a law that ◄no one can change/cannot be changed.► Write a law that states that Queen Vashti will never be allowed to see you again and will not continue to be the queen. Then you can choose another woman to be queen, a woman who deserves to be queen more than Vashti does."}

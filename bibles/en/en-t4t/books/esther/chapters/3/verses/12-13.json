{"verse":"12-13","text":"On April 17th Haman summoned the king’s secretaries, and he dictated a letter to them that they translated and wrote to all the governors and administrators and other officials in all the provinces. They wrote copies of the letter in every language and every kind of writing/alphabet that was used in the empire. They wrote that all the Jews, including young people and old people, women and children, had to be killed on one day. That day was March 7th of the following year. They also wrote that those who killed the Jews could take everything that belonged to the Jews. They signed the king’s name at the end of the letters. Then they sealed the letters with wax, and stamped the wax by using the king’s ring. Then they sent the letters swiftly to every province in the empire,"}

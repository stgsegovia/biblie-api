{"verse":"14","text":"So Haman’s wife Zeresh and all his friends who were there suggested, “Why don’t you quickly set up ◄a gallows/posts on which to hang someone►. Make it 75 feet tall. Then tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai on it. After that, you can go to the banquet with the king and be cheerful.” That idea pleased Haman very much, so he gave men orders to set up the gallows/posts."}

{"verse":"2","text":"When Mordecai came in, the king took off the ring that had his official seal on it, the ring that he had previously given to Haman, and gave it to Mordecai, to indicate that Mordecai was now his most important official. And Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of everything that had belonged to Haman."}

{"verse":"8","text":"So now you must take to Job seven young bulls and seven rams and kill them and burn them on the altar as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he requests me to do, and I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about me. I will not punish you, even though you deserve to be punished, because what you said about me was not right/true, but what Job said about me was right/true.‚Äù"}

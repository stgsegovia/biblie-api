{"verse":"11","text":"All the elders and the others who were sitting at the town gate agreed, and one of them said, â€œYes, we are witnesses. We hope/desire that Yahweh will enable this woman, who will be coming into your home, to give birth to many children, as Rachel and Leah did. They are the women from whom all us people [MTY] of Israel are descended. We hope that you will become rich in the clan of Ephratah, and become famous [MTY] here in Bethlehem."}

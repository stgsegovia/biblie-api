{"verse":"10","text":"Boaz replied, “Young lady, I hope that Yahweh will ◄bless/be kind to► you! You have acted kindly toward your mother-in-law, and now you are acting even more kindly toward me by wanting to marry me, instead of wanting to marry a young man. You have not looked for either a rich young man or a poor young man, to marry him."}

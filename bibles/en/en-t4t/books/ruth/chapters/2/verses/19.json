{"verse":"19","text":"Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? In whose field did you work? God will surely bless the man who was kind to you.” Then Ruth told her about the man in whose field she had been working. She said, “The name of the man who owns the field where I worked today is Boaz.”"}

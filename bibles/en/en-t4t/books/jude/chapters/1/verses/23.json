{"verse":"23","text":"Rescue others from the influence of those who teach what is false [MET], as you would rescue things by snatching them from a fire. Pity those whom the teachers of false doctrine have completely convinced, but beware that you yourselves are not influenced by them {that they do not influence you}. Detest doing or even thinking about the sins that those people commit, just like you would detest [MET] touching not only filthy things but the clothes that were stained by those things {that those things stained}."}

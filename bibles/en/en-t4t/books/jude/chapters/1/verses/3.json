{"verse":"3","text":"You whom I love, I ◄was very eager/very much wanted► to write to you about that which we all ◄share/have in common►, which is how ◄God/Jesus Christ► has saved us.

Jesus and his apostles gave that truth once and for all to us who belong to God, and we must not let it be changed {anyone revise/change it}."}

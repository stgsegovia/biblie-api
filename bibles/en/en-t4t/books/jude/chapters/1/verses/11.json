{"verse":"11","text":"God will do terrible things to those who teach false doctrine! They conduct their lives wickedly like Cain, who murdered his brother because he was ◄jealous/angry because God accepted his brother’s sacrifice and did not accept his►. These false teachers ◄devote themselves to [MET] doing wrong things like Balaam, who tried to induce God’s people to sin in order to get the money that was offered to him. They will perish like Korah, who rebelled against the authority that God gave to Moses."}

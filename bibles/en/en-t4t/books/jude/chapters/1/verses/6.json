{"verse":"6","text":"And there were many angels to whom God assigned/gave positions of authority in heaven. But many did not continue to rule with authority in those positions. Instead, they abandoned the place that God gave them to live in heaven. So God has put those angels in chains forever in the darkness in hell. They will stay there until the great day when God will judge and punish them."}

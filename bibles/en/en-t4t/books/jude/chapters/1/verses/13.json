{"verse":"13","text":"They are restless [MET], like the pounding waves of the ocean. Just like waves produce foul-smelling foam on the shore, those teachers of false doctrine do shameful [MTY] deeds. We cannot depend/rely on them to show us how to conduct our lives [MET], just like we cannot depend/rely on ◄meteors/falling stars► to show us the way when we travel. God has reserved intense darkness for them forever in hell."}

{"verse":"12","text":"Those teachers of false doctrine are as dangerous to you as [MET] ◄hidden rocks on a reef/rocks underneath the surface of the ocean► are to a boat. When you gather together to eat the meals that help you believers to love each other more and have a closer relationship with each other, they join you and carouse shamelessly, caring only for themselves and not for others. Because they do not do anything to help others [MET], they are as useless as clouds that are blown along by the wind {that the wind blows along} but that do not produce/give any rain. They are as disappointing as [MET] trees that do not produce fruit in the autumn as we expect them to. They are not only spiritually [MET] dead themselves, but they are not able to cause others to be alive spiritually, just like [MET] trees that have been {that someone has} uprooted and as a result are unable to produce any fruit."}

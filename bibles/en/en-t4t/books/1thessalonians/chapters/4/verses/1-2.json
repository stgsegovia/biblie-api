{"verse":"1-2","text":"Now, my fellow believers, I want to write about some other matters. Because we all have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus, we(exc) strongly urge you [DOU] to live in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that, and you know that we lived that way as a result of what the Lord Jesus told us. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but we strongly urge that you do that even more."}

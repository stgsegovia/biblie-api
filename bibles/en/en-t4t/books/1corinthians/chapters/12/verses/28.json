{"verse":"28","text":"God has placed apostles in our congregations. Apostles are first in rank. Next in rank are those who speak messages which come directly from God. Next in rank are those who teach spiritual truth. Then there are those who have the power to work miracles, those who have the ability to heal sick people, those who have the ability to help others, those who have the ability to govern the affairs of the congregation, and those who have the ability to speak messages in languages [MTY] that they have not learned."}

{"verse":"22","text":"When I was with those who doubt whether God will permit them to do certain things that others ◄disapprove of/think it is not right to do►, I avoided doing those things, in order that I might convince some of them to trust in Christ. In summary, I have done all the things that the people I have been with think that others should do, in order that by every possible means I might convince some of them to trust in Christ."}

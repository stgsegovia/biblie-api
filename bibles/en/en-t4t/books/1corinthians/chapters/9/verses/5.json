{"verse":"5","text":"We have the same right that the other apostles and the Lord Jesusâ€™ younger brothers and especially Peter have. They all take along a wife who is a believer when they travel various places in order to tell people about Christ. And they have a right that the people whom they work among will support their wives, too. So Barnabas and I certainly have those same rights. [RHQ]"}

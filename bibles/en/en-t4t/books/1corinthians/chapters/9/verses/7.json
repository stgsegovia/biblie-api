{"verse":"7","text":"Soldiers certainly do not pay their own wages. [RHQ] Those who plant a vineyard would certainly eat some of the grapes when they become ripe. [RHQ] Those who care for sheep would certainly drink the milk from those sheep. [RHQ] Similarly, those who tell others about Christ certainly have a right to receive ◄financial help/food► from the people to whom they preach."}

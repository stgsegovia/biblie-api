{"verse":"21","text":"When I was with ◄non-Jews/those who do not know those laws►, I did the things that non-Jews think that people should do, in order that I might convince some of them to trust in Christ. I do not mean that I disobey God’s laws. No, I obey the things that Christ commanded us to do."}

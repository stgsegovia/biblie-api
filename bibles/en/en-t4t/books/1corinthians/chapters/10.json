All those ancestors crossed the Red Sea after God miraculously made the water separate so that they could walk through it."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"2","text":"God caused all of them to begin to live under the authority of [MTY] Moses when they walked under that cloud and walked through the Red Sea."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"3","text":"All those ancestors of ours ate the same food that God miraculously provided."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"4","text":"They all drank water that God miraculously provided. That is, they all drank water that God miraculously made come out of the rock. That rock was a symbol of [MET] Christ, who went with them. So we conclude that God helped all of those people in many ways."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"5","text":"However, we also conclude that God was angry [LIT] with most of those people because they sinned against him. He caused almost all of them to die, and as a result their bodies were scattered in the desert."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"6","text":"Those things that happened long ago became examples to teach us the following things: We should not desire to do evil things as those people desired to do."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"7","text":"We should not worship idols as many of those people did.

As a result, God punished them by causing 23,000 people to die in only one day."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"9","text":"We should not try to see how much we can sin without the Lord punishing us. Some of them did that, and as a result they died because poisonous snakes bit them."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"10","text":"We should not complain about what God does. Some of them did that, and as a result an angel destroyed them. So God will certainly punish us if we sin like they did."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"11","text":"All those things that happened to our ancestors long ago are examples for us. Moses wrote those things to warn us who are living at this time which is near the end.

But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God to help you. He will not permit you to be tempted {anything to tempt you} more than you are able to resist. Instead, when you are tempted {things tempt you}, he will also provide a way for you to endure it without sinning."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"14","text":"So, I say to you people whom I love, avoid worshipping idols just like you would run away from anything that is dangerous."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"10","verse":"15","text":"It is to people who think that they are wise that I write.

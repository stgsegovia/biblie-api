{"verse":"10","text":"For example, you know that idols are not really alive. Suppose that in a temple where they worship idols you eat food that has been sacrificed to idols. Suppose that someone who is not sure whether God allows us to eat that food sees you eating it. You would be encouraging him to eat it, too. [RHQ]"}

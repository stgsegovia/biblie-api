{"verse":"2","text":"Every Sunday each of you should set aside at home some funds [EUP] for this purpose, in proportion to how much God has prospered you. Then you should save it up, so that when I arrive there, you will not need to collect any more money. Choose some men whom you approve of, to take this money to Jerusalem."}

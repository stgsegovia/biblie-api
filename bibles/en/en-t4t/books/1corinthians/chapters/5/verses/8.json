{"verse":"8","text":"So let us celebrate the fact that God has freed us from being punished us for our sins [MET], just like the Jews in later years celebrated Passover to celebrate God freeing them from being slaves in Egypt. They made sure that there was no old yeast in the dough. They ate bread that had no yeast in it. Similarly, we should make sure that there are no people in our congregations [MET] who act maliciously toward others or act wickedly. Instead, make sure [MET] that all those in our congregations are ones who act sincerely and speak truthfully."}

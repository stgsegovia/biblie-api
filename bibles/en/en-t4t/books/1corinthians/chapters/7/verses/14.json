{"verse":"14","text":"I say that because God has set apart every woman’s unbelieving husband for himself because of his wife being a believer, and God has set apart every man’s unbelieving wife for himself because of her husband being a believer. If that were not true, God would consider their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that God does consider them acceptable to him."}

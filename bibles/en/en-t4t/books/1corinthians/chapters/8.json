We know what some of you say, that God has enabled all of us to know the truth about things such as idols. But often we become proud because we say that we know all those things. But instead of being proud about what we know, we should show that we love our fellow believers by helping them to become spiritually mature."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"8","verse":"2","text":"Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"8","verse":"3","text":"But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"8","verse":"4","text":"So I will tell you about eating meat that people have sacrificed to idols.

So, when they eat such meat, they think that they have sinned."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"8","verse":"8","text":"But God will not think more highly about us if we eat certain foods, or if we do not eat certain foods.

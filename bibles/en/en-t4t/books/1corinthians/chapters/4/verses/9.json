{"verse":"9","text":"But it seems as though God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners at the end of the victorâ€™s parade. We (exc) are like men who have been condemned to die, who have been put in the arena where everyone can see the wild animals killing them. And not only people, but even angels all over the world are watching us, as people watch those who are performing a play in a theater."}

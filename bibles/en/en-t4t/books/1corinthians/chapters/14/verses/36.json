{"verse":"36","text":"If you do not agree with these things that I have been telling you, remember that [RHQ] the message from God did not first come from you people in Corinth. Also, you are not [RHQ] the only ones who have heard it! Many others have heard it and accepted it, so you should not act as though you are the only believers who have heard the message from God."}

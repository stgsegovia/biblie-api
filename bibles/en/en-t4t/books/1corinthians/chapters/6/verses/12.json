{"verse":"12","text":"Some of you may say, “God allows us to do anything that he does not forbid.” But I would reply, “That is true, but not everything that God permits us to do helps us.” Yes, as some of you say, God permits us to do anything that he does not forbid. But as for me, I will not let anything make me its slave; that is, I will not do anything that will gain control over me in such a way that I will not be able to stop doing it."}

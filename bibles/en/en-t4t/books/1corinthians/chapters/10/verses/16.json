{"verse":"16","text":"During the Lord’s Supper, after we ask God to bless ◄the wine/the juice► in the cup, we give thanks for it and drink it. By doing that, we certainly are [RHQ] sharing in what Christ did for us when his blood flowed from his body when he died. During the Lord’s Supper, when we break the bread and eat it, we are certainly sharing in [MTY] what Christ did for us when his body suffered for us on the cross. [RHQ]"}

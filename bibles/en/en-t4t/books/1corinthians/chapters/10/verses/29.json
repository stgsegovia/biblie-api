{"verse":"29","text":"I do not mean that you should be concerned about whether it is all right to eat such food. What I mean is that you should be concerned about others who may think that it is wrong to eat such food. Since I know that I ◄am free/have the right► to eat such food without God punishing me, no one should [RHQ] say that what I am doing is wrong just because he himself thinks that it is wrong."}

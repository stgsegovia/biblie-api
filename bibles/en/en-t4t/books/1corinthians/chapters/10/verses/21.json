{"verse":"21","text":"When you drink the grape juice/wine in [MTY] the cup at the Lord’s Supper, you cannot participate in the blessings that the Lord Jesus brought to us and at the same time drink the wine in the [MTY] cup that people offer to demons! When you eat at the Lord’s table, you cannot participate in the blessings the Lord provided [MTY] when he died for us and at the same time participate in the things that represent demons by eating food that has been sacrificed to idols"}

But I did not proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would think was very wise."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"2","text":"I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you what he accomplished for us when he was killed by being nailed {when they killed him by nailing him} to a cross."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"3","text":"Furthermore, when I was with you, I felt that I was not adequate to do what Christ wanted me to do. I was afraid that I would not be able to do it, and because of that I was trembling very much."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"4","text":"When I taught you and preached to you, I did not speak words that unbelievers would consider [IRO] wise in order to convince them that my message was true. Instead, God’s Spirit showed that it was true by enabling me to powerfully perform miracles."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"5","text":"I taught and preached that way in order that you might believe my message, not because you heard words that people considered to be [IRO] wise, but because you recognized God’s power."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"6","text":"I do teach a message that people who are spiritually mature consider to be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers consider to be wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise. What they think about it does not matter, because some day ◄they will lose their power/not be ruling any more►."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"2","verse":"7","text":"Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely long ago.

As I do that, I do not tell you things that someone whom others thought was [IRO] wise taught me.

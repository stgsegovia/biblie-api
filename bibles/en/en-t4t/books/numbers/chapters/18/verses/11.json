{"verse":"11","text":"â€œhe priests lift up high the sacred offerings while they are standing in front of the altar. All of those offerings that the Israelis offer to me belong to you and your sons and daughters. They will always be your share. All the members of your family who have performed the rituals to cause them to  be acceptable to me are permitted to eat from these offerings."}

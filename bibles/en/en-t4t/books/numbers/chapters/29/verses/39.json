{"verse":"39","text":"“t your festivals, these are the offerings that you must bring to me: The offerings that will be completely burned on the altar, the offerings of grain and wine, and the offerings to maintain fellowship with me. Those are in addition to the offerings that you give to me because you promised to do something, and other special offerings that you want to give to me.”"}

{"verse":"20","text":"You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe/despise it, and it will cause you to want to vomit. This will happen because you have rejected Yahweh who is here among you, and you have wailed in his presence, saying “e would have had better food to eat if we had not left Egypt [RHQ].”’”"}

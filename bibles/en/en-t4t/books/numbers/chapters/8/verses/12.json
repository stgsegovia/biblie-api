{"verse":"12","text":"â€œAfter that, the descendants of Levi must place their hands on the heads of the two bulls. Then the bulls will be killed and burned on the altar. One will be an offering to enable me to forgive them for the sins they have committed, and the other will be completely burned to please me."}

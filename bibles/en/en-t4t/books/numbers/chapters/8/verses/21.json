{"verse":"21","text":"The descendants of Levi sprinkled themselves with water to symbolize that they had been freed/cleansed from the guilt of their sins, and they washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar to present them to Yahweh, and he offered sacrifices to cleanse them from the guilt of their sins and cause them to become acceptable to Yahweh."}

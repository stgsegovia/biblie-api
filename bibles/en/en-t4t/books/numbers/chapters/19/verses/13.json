{"verse":"13","text":"All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahwehâ€™s Sacred Tent. They will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me."}

{"verse":"8","text":"If the person against whom the wrong was done has died and there is no relative to whom the money can be paid, then the money belongs to me, and it must be paid to the priest. In addition, the one who did the wrong must give a male sheep to the priest to sacrifice in order that ◄that person’s sin may be forgiven/I can forgive that person for his sin►."}

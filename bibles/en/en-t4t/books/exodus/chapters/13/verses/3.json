{"verse":"3","text":"Moses/I said to the people, â€œDo not forget this day! This is the day that you are leaving Egypt. This is the day you are freed from being their slaves. Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt by his great power [MTY]. Do not eat any bread that has yeast in it whenever you celebrate this day."}

{"verse":"16","text":"The man who was the ◄priest/one who offered the people’s gifts to God► for the Midian people, whose name was Jethro, had seven daughters. One day as Moses/I sat down beside a well, those girls came to the well and got water, and filled the troughs in order to give water to their father’s flock of sheep."}

{"verse":"23","text":"When Yahweh goes throughout Egypt to kill the oldest male in each Egyptian family, he will see the blood on the ◄lintels/beams of your doorways►, and he will ignore and pass by those houses. He will not allow the angel who causes people to die to enter your houses and kill any of your oldest sons."}

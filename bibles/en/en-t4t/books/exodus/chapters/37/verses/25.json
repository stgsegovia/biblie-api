{"verse":"25","text":"From acacia wood, Bezalel made the altar for burning incense. It was square, ◄18 in./45 cm.► on each side. It was ◄3 ft./90 cm.► high. He made a projection that looked like a horn on each of the top corners. The projections were carved from the same block of wood that the altar was made of."}

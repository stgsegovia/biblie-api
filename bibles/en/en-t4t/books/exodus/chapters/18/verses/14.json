{"verse":"14","text":"When Jethro saw everything that Moses/I was doing for the people, he said, “◄Why are you doing all this for the people?/You should not be doing all this for the people!► [RHQ] Why are you doing this by yourself, and all the people are crowding around you, from morning until evening, asking you to make decisions for them [RHQ]?”"}

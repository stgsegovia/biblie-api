{"verse":"17","text":"So now Yahweh says this: â€œThis is the way you will know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do. Watch this: I am going to strike the water that is in the Nile River with the stick that is in my hand. When I do that, the water will become blood (OR, red like blood [MTY])."}

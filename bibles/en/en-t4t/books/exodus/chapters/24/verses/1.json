{"verse":"1","text":"Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, â€œCome to me, up on top of this mountain, you and Aaron and his sons Nadab and Abihu. Also take along 70 of the Israeli elders/leaders. While you are still some distance from the top of the mountain, prostrate yourselves on the ground and worship me."}

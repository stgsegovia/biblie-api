{"verse":"7","text":"Then he/I took the scroll on which he/I had written everything that Yahweh had commanded in the agreement that he had made, and he/I read it aloud, while all the people were listening. Then all the people said, “We will do all that Yahweh has told us to do. We will obey everything.”"}

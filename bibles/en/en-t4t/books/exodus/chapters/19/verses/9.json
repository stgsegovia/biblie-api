{"verse":"9","text":"Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen carefully: I am going to appear to you from inside a thick cloud. When I am speaking to you, the people will hear it, and they will always trust in you.” Then Moses/I went down the mountain and reported to the people what Yahweh said. Then he/I went back up the mountain and told Yahweh what the people replied."}

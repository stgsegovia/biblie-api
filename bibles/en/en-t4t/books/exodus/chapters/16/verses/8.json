{"verse":"8","text":"Then Moses/I also said, “From now on, each evening Yahweh will give you meat to eat, and each morning he will give you something that will take the place of bread, because he has heard what you have complained about. Yahweh is the one to whom you have really complained, not us. We are just his servants.” [RHQ]"}

{"verse":"4","text":"Yahweh said to Moses/me, â€œListen to what I am going to do. I am going to send something from the sky that will take the place of bread for all of you. When I do that, the people must go out of their tents every day and gather just enough to eat on that day. When I do that, I will find out whether they will obey my instructions or not."}

{"verse":"6","text":"Listen carefully: I will stand in front of you on top of a large rock at the foot of the mountain. Strike the rock with your stick. When you do that, water for the people to drink will flow out of the rock.‚Äù When they/we arrived at the mountain, Moses/I did that while the Israeli elders were watching, and water flowed from the rock."}

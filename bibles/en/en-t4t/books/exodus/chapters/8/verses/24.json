{"verse":"24","text":"Early the next morning, Moses/I told that to the king, but the king would not pay any attention. So Yahweh did what he said he would do. He sent great swarms of flies into the palace of the king and into the houses of his officials. The whole country of Egypt was ruined by the flies."}

{"verse":"3","text":"Not only will the Nile River be full of frogs, but the frogs will come up out of the river into your palace. They will come into your bedroom and onto your bed. They will be in the houses of your officials and all the rest of your people. They will even get into your ovens and your pans for mixing the materials for baking bread."}

{"verse":"29","text":"Moses/I said, “Listen to me! After I leave you, I will pray to Yahweh, asking that tomorrow he will cause the swarms of flies to leave you and your officials and the rest of your people. But do not deceive us again by refusing to let our people go to offer sacrifices to Yahweh!”"}

{"verse":"9","text":"If two people argue about which one of them owns a bull or a donkey or a sheep or some clothing, or something else that has been lost, the two people who each claim/say that the item belongs to them must stand before the judges. The one whom the judges declare is lying must pay back to the real owner twice as many bulls or donkeys or sheep or pieces of clothing."}

{"verse":"15-16","text":"Yahweh said to Moses/me, â€œTell the people to stop crying out for me to help them, and tell them to go forward. Lift up your stick and stretch it out toward the sea. The water will divide, so that all you Israeli people can go in the middle of the sea, walking on dry ground."}

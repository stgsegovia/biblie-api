{"verse":"15","text":"God also said to Moses/me, “Say this to the Israeli people: ‘Yahweh God, the one your ancestors worshiped, the one that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob worshiped, has sent me to you.’ This name, Yahweh, will be my name forever. That is the name that people in all future generations must use when they talk about/to me."}

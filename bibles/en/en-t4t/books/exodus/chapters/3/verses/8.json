{"verse":"8","text":"So I have come down from heaven to rescue them from the Egyptians [SYN]. I have come to bring them up from that land to the highlands in Canaan. I will bring them to a land that is good/fertile and that has plenty of space. It will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops [MTY]. It is the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus live."}

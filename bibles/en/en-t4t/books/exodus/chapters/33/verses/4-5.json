{"verse":"4-5","text":"Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Tell the Israeli people, ‘You are very stubborn [IDM]. If I would go with you for even a moment, I would completely ◄get rid of you/wipe you out►. Now take off your jewelry to show that you are sorry for having sinned. Then I will decide how I will punish you (OR, if I should punish you).’” So when Moses/I told to the people what God said, they started to mourn, and they all took off their jewelry."}

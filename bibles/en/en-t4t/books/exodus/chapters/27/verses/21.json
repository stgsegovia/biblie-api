{"verse":"21","text":"They must put the lampstand outside of the curtain which is in front of the sacred chest which contains the stone slabs on which I have written my commandments. Aaron must take care of the lamps. After he dies, his descendants must do this work. The lamps are to burn every night, from evening until morning. The Israeli people must obey this regulation throughout all future generations.‚Äù"}

{"verse":"10","text":"But Amasa did not see that Joab was holding another dagger in his other hand. And Joab stabbed it into Amasaâ€™s belly, and his insides spilled out onto the ground. Amasa died immediately; Joab did not need to stab him again. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued to pursue Sheba."}

{"verse":"22","text":"Then this wise woman went to the elders of the town and told them what she had said to Joab. So they cut off Shebaâ€™s head and threw it over the wall to Joab. Then Joab blew his trumpet to signal that the battle was ended, and all his soldiers left the town and returned to their homes. And Joab returned to Jerusalem and told the king what had happened."}

{"verse":"8","text":"On that day, David said to his soldiers, “Those who want to get rid of the Jebus people-group should go through the water tunnel to enter the city. Then they can attack those people whom I [SYN] detest—and we will find out if any blind and crippled people will be able to stop them!” That is why people say, “Blind and crippled people cannot enter Yahweh’s temple.”"}

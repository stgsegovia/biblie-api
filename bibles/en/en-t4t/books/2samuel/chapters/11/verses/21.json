{"verse":"21","text":"Do you not remember how Abimelech, the son of Gideon, was killed? A woman who lived in Thebez threw a huge ◄millstone/stone for grinding grain► on him from the top of a tower, and he died. So why did your troops go near to the city wall?’ If the king asks this, then tell him, ‘Your officer Uriah also was killed.’ ”"}

{"verse":"14","text":"And when the soldiers of the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from Syria were running away, they also started to run away from Abishai and his army, and they retreated back inside the city. So Joabâ€™s army stopped fighting against the army of the Ammon people-group, and Joab and his army returned to Jerusalem."}

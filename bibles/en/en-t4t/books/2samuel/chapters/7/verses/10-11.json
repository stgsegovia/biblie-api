{"verse":"10-11","text":"Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israeli people, many violent groups oppressed the Israelis. But this will not happen any more. I have chosen a place where my Israeli people can live peacefully and no one will disturb them any more. I will give them rest from being attacked by their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies."}

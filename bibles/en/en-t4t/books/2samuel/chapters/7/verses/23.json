{"verse":"23","text":"And there is no other nation in the world like Israel. Israel is the only nation on the earth whose people you went out to rescue [RHQ]. By the great and awesome things that you did, you have become famous/well-known throughout the world. As your people advanced through this land, you expelled other people-groups who were here in Canaan, who worshiped other gods."}

{"verse":"14","text":"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in Zela town in the land of the tribe of Benjamin. Doing all that the king commanded, they buried their bones in the tomb where Saul’s father Kish was buried. After that, because God saw that Saul’s family had been punished to pay for Saul’s murder of many people from Gibeon, he answered the Israelis’ prayers for their land, and caused the famine to end."}

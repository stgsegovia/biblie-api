{"verse":"10","text":"Then Rizpah took coarse cloth made from goatsâ€™ hair, and spread it on the rock where the corpses lay. She stayed there from the time that people started to harvest the barley until the rains started. She did not allow any birds to come near the corpses during the day, and she did not allow any animals to come near during the night."}

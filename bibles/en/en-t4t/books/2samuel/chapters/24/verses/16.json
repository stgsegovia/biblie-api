{"verse":"16","text":"When Yahweh’s angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy the people by this plague, Yahweh changed his mind about punishing any more people. He said to the angel who was killing them with the plague, “Stop what you are doing [IDM]! That is enough!” When he said that, the angel was standing at the ground where Araunah, from the Jebus people-group, threshed grain."}

{"verse":"17","text":"When David saw the angel who was causing the people to become sick and die, he said to Yahweh, “Truly, I am the one who has committed the sin. I have done a very wicked thing, but these people are as innocent as sheep [MET]. They have certainly not [RHQ] done anything that is wrong. So you should punish [IDM] me and my family, not these people!”"}

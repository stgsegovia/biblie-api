{"verse":"13","text":"So Gad went to David and told him what Yahweh had said. He said to David, “You can choose whether there will be three years of famine in your land, or three months of your army running away from your enemies, or three days when there will be a ◄plague/very severe illness► in your land. You think about it and choose which one you want, and tell me, and I will return to Yahweh and tell him what your answer is.”"}

{"verse":"24","text":"But the king said to Araunah, “No, I will not take these things as a gift. I will pay you for it. I will not take sacrifices that have cost me nothing, and offer them to Yahweh to be completely burned on the altar.” So he paid 50 pieces of silver to Araunah for the oxen and the ground."}

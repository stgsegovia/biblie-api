{"verse":"31","text":"Then they brought the people of Rabbah out of the city and forced them to work for them using saws and iron picks and axes. David’s troops also forced them to make bricks. David’s soldiers did this in all the towns of the Ammon people-group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem."}

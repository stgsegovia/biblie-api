{"verse":"22","text":"But David said, “You sons of Zeruiah, what am I going to do with you? (OR, you are not the ones who should decide what to do to him). It is as though you have become my enemies today. I know that I am the one who has now become the king of Israel, so I say that certainly no one [RHQ] in Israel should be executed today.”"}

{"verse":"32","text":"Absalom replied, “Because you did not come to me when I sent messages to you requesting that you come. I wanted to request that you go to the king to say to him, ‘Absalom ◄wants to know what good it did/says that is was useless► [RHQ] for him [RHQ] to leave Geshur and come here. He thinks that it would have been better for him to have stayed there. He wants you to allow him to talk to you. And if you think that he has done something that is wrong, you can command that he be executed.’”"}

{"verse":"14","text":"But when I realized that they were not acting according to the truth of the message about Christ, when all the fellow believers there were present, I told Peter the following: “Although you (sg) are a Jew, you often conduct yourself like non-Jews do by disregarding Jewish laws about food. When you are among non-Jews, you (sg) do not customarily conduct yourself at all like Jews do. So, ◄now it is wrong that you (sg) are causing non-Jews to think that they must obey all the Jewish rituals and customs!/why are you (sg) causing non-Jews to think that they must obey all the Jewish rituals and customs?► [RHQ]”"}

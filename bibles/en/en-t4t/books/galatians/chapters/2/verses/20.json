{"verse":"20","text":"It is as though I was with Christ when he was crucified {died on the cross} [MET] (OR, It is as though my old way of life ended when Christ died on the cross.) No longer am I directing the way I behave as I did before I believed in Christ. Now Christ is directing how I behave. And whatever I do now while I live, I do it trusting in Godâ€™s Son. He is the one who loved me and offered himself as a sacrifice for me."}

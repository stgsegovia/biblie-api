{"verse":"4","text":"Those of you who are sure that God will erase the record of your sins because you obey the laws that God gave to Moses, you have separated yourselves from Christ. You have abandoned/rejected Godâ€™s true method of saving you, which was by kindly erasing the record of your sins, in a way that you did not deserve."}

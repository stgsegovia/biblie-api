Furthermore, each of you who corrects another person should be very cautious in order that you might not sin like that when you are tempted {when something tempts you}."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"2","text":"When there are ones who have problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will complete what Christ requires."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"3","text":"Keep in mind that those who refuse to help others because they think that they are more important than other people, although they are not really more important, are deceiving themselves."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"4","text":"Instead, each of you should constantly test/judge and decide if you can approve what you yourself are doing and thinking. Then you can boast because of what you yourself are doing and thinking, and not because what you are doing is superior to what other persons are doing."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"5","text":"Keep in mind that you must each perform your own individual tasks."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"6","text":"You who are being taught {whom others are teaching} God’s truth should share your various material things [EUP] with your teachers."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"7","text":"You should not deceive yourselves.

They are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone must circumcise you}. They are doing that only in order that other Jews would no longer ◄persecute them/cause them to suffer► for proclaiming that God will save us because of our trusting in what Christ accomplished when he died on the cross [MTY, MET]."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"6","verse":"13","text":"The reason that I say that is that the ones who are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone circumcise you} do not themselves fully obey the laws that God gave to Moses.

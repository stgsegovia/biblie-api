{"verse":"1","text":"My fellow believers, if you discover that a person among your congregation is sinning, those of you whom Godâ€™s Spirit is directing and empowering should gently correct that person. Furthermore, each of you who corrects another person should be very cautious in order that you might not sin like that when you are tempted {when something tempts you}."}

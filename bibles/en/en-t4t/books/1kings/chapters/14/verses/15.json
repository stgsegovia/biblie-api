{"verse":"15","text":"Yahweh will punish the people of Israel; he will shake them like the wind shakes the reeds that grow in a stream. He will expel the Israeli people from this good land that he gave to our ancestors. He will scatter them into countries east of the Euphrates River, because they have caused him to become very angry by worshiping statues of the goddess Asherah."}

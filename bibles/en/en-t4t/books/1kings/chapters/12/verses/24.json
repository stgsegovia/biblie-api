{"verse":"24","text":"‘Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against your own relatives, the people of Israel. All of you must go home. What has happened is what Yahweh wanted to happen.’ ” So Shemaiah went and told that to them, and they all paid attention to what Yahweh had commanded them to do, and they went home."}

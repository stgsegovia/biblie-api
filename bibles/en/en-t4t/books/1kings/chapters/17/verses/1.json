{"verse":"1","text":"Elijah was a prophet who lived in Tishbe town in the Gilead region. One day he went to King Ahab and said to him, “Yahweh is the God whom we Israelis worship and the God whom I worship and serve. Just as certainly as Yahweh lives, there will be no dew or rain for the next few years, if I do not command rain to fall!”"}

{"verse":"29","text":"“I have seen [RHQ] that Ahab is now very sorry for all the evil things that he has done. So the things that I promised to do to his family will not happen while he is still alive. I will cause them to happen after his son becomes king. Then those things will happen to his family.” [MTY]"}

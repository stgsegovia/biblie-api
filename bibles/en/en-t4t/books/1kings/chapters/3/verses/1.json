{"verse":"1","text":"Solomon went to see the king of Egypt. Solomon made an agreement with him to marry his daughter. They also made an alliance/agreement that their armies would not attack each other. Then Solomon brought the king’s daughter to live in the part of Jerusalem called ‘The City of David’. She lived there until Solomon’s workers had finished building his house and the temple of Yahweh and the wall around Jerusalem."}

{"verse":"26","text":"Then Solomon said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to Anathoth town, to your land there. You deserve to be killed, but I will not execute you now, because you were the one who supervised the men who carried Yahweh’s Sacred Chest for David my father, and you endured all the troubles that my father endured.”"}

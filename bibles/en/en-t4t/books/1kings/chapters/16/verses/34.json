{"verse":"34","text":"During the years that Ahab ruled, Hiel, a man from Bethel city, rebuilt Jericho city. But when he started to rebuild the city, his oldest son Abiram died. And when the city was finished, while Hiel was building the city gates, his youngest son Segub died. They died just like Yahweh had told Joshua would happen to the sons of anyone who would rebuild Jericho."}

{"verse":"28","text":"A prophet came to King Ahab and said to him, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘The Syrians say that I am a god who lives in the hills, and that I am not a god who lives in the valleys. So I will show that they are wrong by enabling your men to defeat this huge army [IDM] in the valley, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have done it.’”"}

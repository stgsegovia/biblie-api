{"verse":"11","text":"Yahweh said to him, “Go out and stand in front of me on this mountain while I pass by.” Suddenly a strong windstorm struck the mountain. As a result, rocks were loosened from the mountainside. But Yahweh was not in the wind. Then there was an earthquake, but Yahweh was not in the earthquake."}

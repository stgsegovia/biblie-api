{"verse":"36","text":"When it was time to offer the evening sacrifices, Elijah walked close to the altar and prayed. He said, â€œYahweh, you who are the God that our ancestors Abraham and Isaac and Jacob worshiped, prove today that you are the God whom the Israeli people should worship, and prove that I am your servant. Prove that I have done all these things because you told me to do them."}

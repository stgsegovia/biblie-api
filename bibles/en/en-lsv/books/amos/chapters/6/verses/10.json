{"verse":"10","text":"And his loved one has lifted him up, even his burner, || To bring forth the bones from the house, || And he said to him who [is] in the sides of the house, || “Is there [any] yet with you?” And he said, “None,” || Then he said, “Hush! We must not make mention of the Name of YHWH.”"}

{"verse":"17","text":"And a man who takes his sister, a daughter of his father or daughter of his mother, and he has seen her nakedness, and she sees his nakednessâ€”it is a shame; and they have been cut off before the eyes of the sons of their people; he has uncovered the nakedness of his sister; he bears his iniquity."}

{"verse":"25","text":"And now, YHWH, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, that which You spoke to him, saying, A man of yours is never cut off from before My face, sitting on the throne of Israelâ€”only, if your sons watch their way, to walk before Me as you have walked before Me."}

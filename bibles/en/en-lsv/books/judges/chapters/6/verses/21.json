{"verse":"21","text":"And the Messenger of YHWH puts forth the end of the staff which [is] in His hand, and comes against the flesh, and against the unleavened things, and the fire goes up out of the rock and consumes the flesh and the unleavened thingsâ€”and the Messenger of YHWH has gone from his eyes."}

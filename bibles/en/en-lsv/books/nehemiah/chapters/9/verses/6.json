{"verse":"6","text":"You [are] He, O YHWH, Yourselfâ€”You have made the heavens, || The heavens of the heavens, and all their host, || The earth and all that [are] on it, || The seas and all that [are] in them, || And You are keeping all of them alive, || And the host of the heavens are bowing themselves to You."}

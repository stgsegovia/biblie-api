{"verse":"4","text":"and Saul says to the bearer of his weapons, “Draw your sword, and pierce me with it, lest they come—these uncircumcised—and have pierced me, and rolled themselves on me”; and the bearer of his weapons has not been willing, for he is greatly afraid, and Saul takes the sword, and falls on it."}

{"verse":"16","text":"And it comes to pass, in his speaking to him, that he says to him, “Have we appointed you for a counselor to the king? For you [must] cease; why do they strike you?” And the prophet ceases and says, “I have known that God has counseled to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”"}

{"verse":"6","text":"And the priests are standing over their charges, and the Levites with instruments of the song of YHWH that David the king made, to give thanks to YHWH, for His kindness [is] for all time, in David’s praising by their hand—and the priests are blowing trumpets opposite them, and all of Israel is standing."}

{"verse":"27","text":"And you, you do not fear, My servant Jacob, || Nor [are] you dismayed, O Israel, || For behold, I am saving you from afarâ€”And your seed from the land of their captivity, || And Jacob has turned back, || And has been at rest, and been at ease, || And there is none disturbing."}

{"verse":"10","text":"And that day [is] to Lord YHWH of Hosts || A day of vengeance, || To be avenged of His adversaries, || And the sword has devoured, and been satisfied, || And it has been watered from their blood, || For a sacrifice [is] to Lord YHWH of Hosts, || In the land of the north, by the Euphrates River."}

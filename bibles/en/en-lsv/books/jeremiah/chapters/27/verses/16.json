{"verse":"16","text":"And to the priests, and to all this people, I have spoken, saying, â€œThus said YHWH: You do not listen to the words of your prophets, who are prophesying to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the house of YHWH are now brought back from Babylon in haste, for they are prophesying falsehood to you."}

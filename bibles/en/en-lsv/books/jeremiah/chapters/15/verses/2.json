{"verse":"2","text":"And it has come to pass, when they say to you, || To where do we go out? That you have said to them, || Thus said YHWH: Those who [are] for death—to death, || And those who are for the sword—to the sword, || And those who are for famine—to famine, || And those who are for captivity—to captivity."}

{"verse":"15","text":"And Johanan son of Kareah has spoken to Gedaliah in secret, in Mizpah, saying, “Please let me go, and I strike Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one knows; why does he strike your soul? And all Judah who are gathered to you have been scattered, and the remnant of Judah has perished.”"}

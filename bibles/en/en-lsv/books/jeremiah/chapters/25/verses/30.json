{"verse":"30","text":"â€œAnd you, you prophesy all these words to them, and have said to them: YHWH roars from the high place, || And gives forth His voice from His holy habitation, || He surely roars for His habitation, || A shout as those treading [the grapes], || God answers all the inhabitants of the land,"}

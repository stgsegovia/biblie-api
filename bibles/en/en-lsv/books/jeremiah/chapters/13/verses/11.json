{"verse":"11","text":"For as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, || So I caused to cleave to Me || The whole house of Israel, || And the whole house of Judah,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “To be to Me for a people, and for a name, || And for praise, and for beauty, || And they have not listened."}

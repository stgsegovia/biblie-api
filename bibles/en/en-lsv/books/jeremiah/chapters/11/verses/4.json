{"verse":"4","text":"That I commanded your fathers, || In the day of My bringing them out from the land of Egypt, || Out of the iron furnace, saying, Listen to My voice, and you have done them, || According to all that I command you, || And you have been to Me for a people, || And I am to you for God,"}

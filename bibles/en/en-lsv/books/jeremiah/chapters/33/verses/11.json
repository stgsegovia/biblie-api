{"verse":"11","text":"A voice of joy and a voice of gladness, || Voice of bridegroom and voice of bride, || The voice of those saying, || Thank YHWH of Hosts, for YHWH [is] good, || For His kindness [is] for all time, || Who are bringing in thanksgiving to the house of YHWH, || For I return the captivity of the land, || As at the first,‚Äù said YHWH."}

{"verse":"16","text":"And it has come to pass, when you are multiplied, || And have been fruitful in the land, || In those days,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “They no longer say, The Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, || Nor does it go up on the heart, || Nor do they remember concerning it, || Nor do they inspect, nor is it made again."}

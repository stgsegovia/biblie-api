{"verse":"6","text":"The burden of the beasts of the south. Into a land of adversity and distress, || Of young lion and of old lion, || From where [are] viper and flying, burning serpent, || They carry their wealth on the shoulder of donkeys, || And their treasures on the hump of camels, || To a people not profitable."}

{"verse":"21","text":"“And I—this [is] My covenant with them,” said YHWH, “My Spirit that [is] on you, || And My words that I have put in your mouth, || Do not depart from your mouth, || And from the mouth of your seed, || And from the mouth of your seed’s seed,” said YHWH, “From now on, even for all time!”"}

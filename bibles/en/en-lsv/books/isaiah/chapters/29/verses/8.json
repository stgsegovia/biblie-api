{"verse":"8","text":"And it has been, as when the hungry dreams, || And behold, he is eating, || And he has awoken, || And his soul [is] empty, || And as when the thirsty dreams, || And behold, he is drinking, || And he has awoken, || And behold, he is weary, || And his soul is longing, || So is the multitude of all the nations || Who are warring against Mount Zion."}

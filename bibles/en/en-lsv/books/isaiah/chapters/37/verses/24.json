{"verse":"24","text":"By the hand of your servants || You have reviled the Lord, and say: In the multitude of my chariots || I have come up to a high place of hills, || The sides of Lebanon, || And I cut down the height of its cedars, || The choice of its firs, || And I enter the high place of its extremity, || The forest of its Carmel."}

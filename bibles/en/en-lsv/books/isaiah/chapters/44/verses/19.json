{"verse":"19","text":"And none turn [it] back to his heart, || Nor has knowledge nor understanding to say, “I have burned half of it in the fire, || Indeed, I have also baked bread over its coals, || I roast flesh and I eat, || And I make its remnant for an abomination, || I fall down to the stock of a tree.”"}

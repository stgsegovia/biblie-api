{"verse":"20","text":"And they have brought all your brothers out of all the nations, || A present to YHWH, || On horses, and on chariot, and on litters, || And on mules, and on dromedaries, || To My holy mountain Jerusalem,” said YHWH, “As the sons of Israel bring the present in a clean vessel, || Into the house of YHWH."}

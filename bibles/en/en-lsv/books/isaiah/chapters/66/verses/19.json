{"verse":"19","text":"And I have set a sign among them, || And have sent out of them those escaping to the nations || (Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing bow, Tubal and Javan, the islands that are far off), || Who have not heard My fame, nor seen My glory, || And they have declared My glory among nations."}

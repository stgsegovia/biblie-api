{"verse":"3","text":"Whoever slaughters the ox strikes a man, || Whoever sacrifices the lamb beheads a dog, || Whoever is bringing up a presentâ€”The blood of a sow, || Whoever is making mention of frankincense, || Is blessing iniquity. Indeed, they have fixed on their own ways, || And their soul has delighted in their abominations."}

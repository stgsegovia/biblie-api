{"verse":"13","text":"If you turn your foot from the Sabbath, || [From] doing your own pleasure on My holy day, || And have cried to the Sabbath, A delight, || To the holy of YHWH, Honored, || And have honored it, without doing your own ways, || Without finding your own pleasure, || And speaking a word."}

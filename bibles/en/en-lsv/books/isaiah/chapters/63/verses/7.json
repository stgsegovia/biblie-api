{"verse":"7","text":"I make mention of the kind acts of YHWH, || The praises of YHWH, || According to all that YHWH has done for us, || And the abundance of the goodness to the house of Israel, || That He has done for them, || According to His mercies, || And according to the abundance of His kind acts."}

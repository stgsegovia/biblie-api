{"verse":"7","text":"At that time a present is brought to YHWH of Hosts, || A nation drawn out and peeled. Even of a people fearful from the beginning until now, || A nation meting out by line, and treading down, || Whose land floods have spoiled, || To the place of the Name of YHWH of Hosts—Mount Zion!”"}

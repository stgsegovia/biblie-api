{"verse":"2","text":"That is sending ambassadors by sea, || Even with implements of reed on the face of the watersâ€”Go, swift messengers, || To a nation drawn out and peeled, || To a people fearful from its beginning and onward, || A nation meeting out by line, and treading down, || Whose land floods have spoiled."}

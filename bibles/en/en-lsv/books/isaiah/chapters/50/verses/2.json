{"verse":"2","text":"Why have I come, and there is no one? I called, and there is none answering, || Has My hand been at all short of redemption? And is there not power in Me to deliver? Behold, by My rebuke I dry up a sea, || I make rivers a wilderness, || Their fish stink, for there is no water, || And die with thirst."}

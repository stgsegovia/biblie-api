{"verse":"9","text":"And those dwelling [in the] cities of Israel have gone out, || And they have burned and kindled [a fire], || With armor, and shield, and buckler, || With bow, and with arrows, || And with hand weapon, and with javelin, || And they have caused a fire to burn seven years with them,"}

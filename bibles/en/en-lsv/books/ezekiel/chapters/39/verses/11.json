{"verse":"11","text":"And it has come to pass in that day, I give a place to Gog thereâ€”a grave in Israel, the valley of those passing by, east of the sea, and it is stopping those passing by, and they have buried there Gog, and all his multitude, and have cried, O valley of the multitude of Gog!"}

{"verse":"17","text":"And you, son of man, thus said Lord YHWH: Say to the birdâ€”every wing, and to every beast of the field: Be assembled and come in, || Be gathered from all around, || For My sacrifice that I am sacrificing for you, || A great sacrifice on mountains of Israel, || And you have eaten flesh, and drunk blood."}

{"verse":"2","text":"And behold, six men are coming from the way of the upper gate, that is facing the north, and each [with] his slaughter-weapon in his hand, and one man in their midst is clothed with linen, and a scribeâ€™s inkhorn at his loins, and they come in, and stand near the bronze altar."}

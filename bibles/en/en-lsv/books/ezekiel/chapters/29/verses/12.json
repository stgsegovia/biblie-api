{"verse":"12","text":"And I have made the land of Egypt a desolation, || In the midst of desolate lands, || And its cities, in the midst of cities [that are] laid waste, || Are a desolation [for] forty years, || And I have scattered the Egyptians among nations, || And I have dispersed them through lands."}

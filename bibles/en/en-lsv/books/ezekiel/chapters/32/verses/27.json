{"verse":"27","text":"And they do not lie with the mighty, || Who are falling of the uncircumcised, || Who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, || And they put their swords under their heads, || And their iniquities are on their bones, || For the terror of the mighty [is] in the land of the living."}

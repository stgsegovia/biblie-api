{"verse":"2","text":"â€œSon of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and you have said to him: You have been like a young lion of nations, || And you [are] as a dragon in the seas, || And you come forth with your flowings, || And trouble the waters with your feet, || And you foul their flowings."}

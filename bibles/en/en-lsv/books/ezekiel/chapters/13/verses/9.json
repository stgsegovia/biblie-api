{"verse":"9","text":"And My hand has been on the prophets, || Who are seeing vanity, and who are divining a lie, || They are not in the assembly of My people, || And they are not written in the writing of the house of Israel, || And they do not come to the ground of Israel, || And you have known that I [am] Lord YHWH."}

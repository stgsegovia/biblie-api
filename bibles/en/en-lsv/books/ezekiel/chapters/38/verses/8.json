{"verse":"8","text":"After many days you are appointed, || In the latter end of the years you come into a land brought back from swordâ€”Gathered out of many peoples, || On mountains of Israel, || That have been for a continuous ruin, || And it has been brought out from the peoples, || And all of them have dwelt safely."}

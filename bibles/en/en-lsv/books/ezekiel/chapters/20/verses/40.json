{"verse":"40","text":"For on My holy mountain, || On the mountain of the height of Israel, || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || All the house of Israel serves Me there, || All of it, in the landâ€”I accept them there, || And I seek your raised-offerings there, || And with the first-fruit of your gifts, || With all your holy things."}

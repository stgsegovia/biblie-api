{"verse":"47","text":"and you have said to the forest of the south, Hear a word of YHWH! Thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I am kindling a fire in you, || And it has devoured every moist tree in you, and every dry tree, || The glowing flames are not quenched, || And all faces from south to north have been burned by it."}

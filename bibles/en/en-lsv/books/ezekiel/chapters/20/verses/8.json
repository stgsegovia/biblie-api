{"verse":"8","text":"And they rebel against Me, || And have not been willing to listen to Me, || Each has not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, || And have not forsaken the idols of Egypt, || And I speakâ€”to pour out My fury on them, || To complete My anger against them, || In the midst of the land of Egypt."}

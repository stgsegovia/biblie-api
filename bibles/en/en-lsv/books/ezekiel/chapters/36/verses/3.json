{"verse":"3","text":"therefore, prophesy, and you have said, Thus said Lord YHWH: Because, even because, of desolating, || And of swallowing you up from all around, || For your being a possession to the remnant of the nations, || And you are taken up on the tip of the tongue, || And [are] an evil report to the people."}

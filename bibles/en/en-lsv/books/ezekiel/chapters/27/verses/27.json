{"verse":"27","text":"Your wealth and your wares, || Your merchandise, your mariners, || And your pilots, strengtheners of your breach, || And the traders of your merchandise, || And all your men of war, who [are] in you, || And in all your assembly that [is] in your midst, || Fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your fall,"}

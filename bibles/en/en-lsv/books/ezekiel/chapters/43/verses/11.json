{"verse":"11","text":"And since they have been ashamed of all that they have done, || The form of the house, and its measurement, || And its outlets, and its inlets, and all its forms, || And all its statutes, even all its forms, || And all its lawsâ€”cause them to know, || And write [it] before their eyes, || And they observe all its forms, || And all its statutes, and have done them."}

{"verse":"2","text":"â€œSon of man, say to the leader of Tyre, Thus said Lord YHWH: Because your heart has been high, || And you say: I [am] a god, || I have inhabited the habitation of God, || In the heart of the seas, || And you [are] man, and not God, || And you give out your heart as the heart of God,"}

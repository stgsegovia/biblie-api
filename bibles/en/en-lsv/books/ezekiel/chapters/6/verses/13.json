{"verse":"13","text":"And you have known that I [am] YHWH, || In their wounded being in the midst of their idols, || Around their altars, || On every high hill, on all tops of mountains, || And under every green tree, and under every thick oak, || The place where they gave refreshing fragrance to all their idols."}

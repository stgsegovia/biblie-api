{"verse":"9","text":"And your escaped have remembered Me among nations, || To where they have been taken captive, || Because I have been broken with their heart that is going whoring, || That has turned aside from off Me, || And with their eyes they are going whoring after their idols, || And they have been loathsome in their own faces, || For the evils that they have doneâ€”all their abominations."}

{"verse":"20","text":"And I have caused you to go down, || With those going down to the pit, || To the people of old, || And I have caused you to dwell || In the lower parts of the earthâ€”in ancient ruins, || With those going down to the pit, || So that you are not inhabited, || And I have given beauty in the land of the living."}

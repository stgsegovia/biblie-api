{"verse":"19","text":"They cast their silver into out-places, || And their gold becomes impurity. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them, || In a day of the wrath of YHWH, || They do not satisfy their soul, || And they do not fill their bowels, || For it has been the stumbling-block of their iniquity."}

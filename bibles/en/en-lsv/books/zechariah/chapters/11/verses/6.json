{"verse":"6","text":"For I no longer have pity on inhabitants of the land, || A declaration of YHWH, || And behold, I am causing man to come forth, || Each into the hand of his neighbor, || And into the hand of his king, || And they have beaten down the land, || And I do not deliver out of their hand.‚Äù"}

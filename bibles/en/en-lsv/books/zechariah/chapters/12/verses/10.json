{"verse":"10","text":"And I have poured on the house of David, || And on the inhabitant of Jerusalem, || The Spirit of grace and supplications, || And they have looked to Me whom they pierced, || And they have mourned over Him, || Like a mourning over the only one, || And they have been in bitterness for Him, || Like a bitterness over the firstborn."}

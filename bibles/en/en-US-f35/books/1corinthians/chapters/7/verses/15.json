{"verse":"15","text":"But if the unbeliever separates, let him separate—in such cases the brother or the sister is not enslaved, but God has called us to peace.In verses 10 and 11, where both are believers (evidently), the Lord forbids divorce and remarriage. Here in verse 15 the subject is a mixed marriage where the unbeliever wants out (verses 12-14 make clear that the believer is not to take the initiative in a separation). There are those who argue that if the unbeliever leaves, the believer is free to remarry, but how can that be true? If remarriage is not allowed if a believing partner leaves (verses 10-11), with what logic can it be argued that the rule changes if the partner is an unbeliever? It simply does not follow. On the contrary, the believer is called upon to make a special effort to win the other. However, if the unbeliever is determined to leave, an effort by the believer to go along at any cost will only prolong a climate of strife, and God has called us to peace. The point of marriage is not to make one's life a hell on earth—it is better to live alone than in unrelenting strife."}

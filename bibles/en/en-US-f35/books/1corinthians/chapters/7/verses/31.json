{"verse":"31","text":"and those who use this world as though not abusing it; because this world's mode is passing away.If the time was short two thousand years ago, it is now that much shorter. The point is that our lives should revolve around Jesus Christ and His Kingdom, not around our own desires and ambitions. There is no lack of marriage seminars that teach how to make each other happy, as if that were the major purpose in life. Not so. Everything in our lives should be subordinated to the interests of Christ's Kingdom, not stroking each other's ego. We like to forget 1 John 2:15-17, but to do so is not smart."}

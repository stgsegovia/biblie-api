{"verse":"38","text":"So then, he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.I suppose that for a couple that is considering marriage, both of them being sincere disciples of Sovereign Jesus, the question should be: “Can we make the greatest contribution to Christ's Kingdom together, or apart?” Verses 36-38 have given considerable exercise to modern commentators, as also to copyists of Greek manuscripts since the third century. The ‘difficulty’ appears to have been to understand just what Paul meant by “virgin”, which resulted in the variant ‘marry’, instead of “give in marriage”."}

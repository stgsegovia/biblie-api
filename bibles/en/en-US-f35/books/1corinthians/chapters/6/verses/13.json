{"verse":"13","text":"Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them.We have to eat to live, but anyone who lives to eat will face an angry Creator. Now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.At first glance this seems awkward; however, that the body is not for fornication is obvious—that is not why the Creator gives us bodies. And we are to consecrate our bodies to the Lord's service, but how is “the Lord for the body”? I don't know, unless it be that ‘body’ is used with two different meanings, first referring to our physical body, next referring to the Church."}

{"verse":"11","text":"And that is what some of you were;Paul makes clear that it is possible to be saved out of any of the practices mentioned, but anyone who dies while still practicing is out, ‘absolutely’. but you were bathed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.The Spirit is the agent."}

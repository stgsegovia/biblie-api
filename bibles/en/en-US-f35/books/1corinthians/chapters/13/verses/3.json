{"verse":"3","text":"Even if I give away all my possessions and hand over my body to be burned,We have here a rather bothersome set of textual variants. For those who can handle Greek I reproduce the statement of evidence from my Greek Text: καυθησομαι f35 (50.6%) OC ‖ καυθησωμαι C (44.7%) HF,RP,TR,CP ‖ καυθησεται (1%) ‖ καυθη (0.8%) ‖ καυχησωμαι 𝕻46(A,B (1.5%) NU ‖ καυχησομαι 048 (0.5%) ‖ four further variants (0.8%). Until 1991, when the collations for select variant sets done by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany appeared, statements of evidence presented the Future Subjunctive form (that of the Textus Receptus) as being attested by the heavy Byzantine majority. Since Greek grammar does not have a Future Subjunctive, there were those who made sport of the Textus Receptus for reproducing a nonexistent form—usually they were partisans of the Aorist Subjunctive form, that changes the verb and is attested by only 1.5% of the manuscripts (of objectively inferior quality). We now know that the real majority form is the Future Indicative, but since it immediately follows ινα, that usually takes the Subjunctive, many scribes may have made the change virtually without thinking. The verb ‘to boast’, as in the eclectic Greek text, is totally out of place here—how can you boast with love? but have not love, it profits me nothing."}

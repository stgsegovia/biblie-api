{"verse":"13","text":"For we also were all baptized into one body by one SpiritIt is the Holy Spirit who places us into the Body of Christ.—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and were all given to drink into one Spirit.The imagery here seems awkward; but if you drink something, it is then inside you, and once regenerate we have the Holy Spirit inside us. But He is much, much bigger than we are, so we wind up inside Him (perhaps a little like swallowing water while swimming)."}

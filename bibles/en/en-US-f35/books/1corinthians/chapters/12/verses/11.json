{"verse":"11","text":"However, the one and the same Spirit produces all of these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.No one gets a gift just because he wants it; the Holy Spirit has His own criteria for distributing them. However, in verse 31 below we are commanded to desire the best gifts. We are to ask, and the Holy Spirit takes it from there."}

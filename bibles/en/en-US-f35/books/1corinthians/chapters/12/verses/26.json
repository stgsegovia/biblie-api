{"verse":"26","text":"and if one member suffers, all the members should suffer along, or if one member is honored, all the members should rejoice along.Since both the Textus Receptus and the eclectic Greek text currently in vogue have ‘suffer’ and ‘rejoice’ in the Indicative (following 60% of the Greek manuscripts), most versions do too. But the 40% includes the best line of transmission and has the verbs in the Subjunctive. Since Paul is applying the figure of a body to people, it is obvious that although we should share, we are not obliged to do so, and often do not."}

{"verse":"3","text":"But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to people.Prophecy is not only for foretelling the future, but all true prophecy comes directly from God. Many churches today give ‘prophesy/prophecy’ an unbiblical meaning, wherein the people tell each other all the good things they hope will happen to them. That is just wishful thinking, not true prophecy."}

{"verse":"19","text":"If it is only for this life that we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.We would be ‘pitiable’ because of contrast between reality and our expectations—our high hopes would be dashed; the higher the hopes, the greater the disappointment. The Christian lifestyle is the best available, even without a resurrection. Paul comes at the question from several angles precisely because the resurrection of Christ is the center piece of our faith. Without it there is no Gospel."}

{"verse":"31","text":"I die every dayPaul could not have been referring to actual physical death, obviously, since Hebrews 9:27 affirms that it is appointed to men to die only once (no reincarnation). He may well have faced possible death often enough, but I suppose he is referring to dying to himself, to his own ambitions, ideas and wishes, so as to embrace God's will.â€”so I affirm by the boasting about you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord."}

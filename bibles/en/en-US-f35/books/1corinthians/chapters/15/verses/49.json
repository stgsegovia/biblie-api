{"verse":"49","text":"And just as we have borne the image of the earth-man, we should also bear the image of the heaven-man.Since both the Textus Receptus and the eclectic Greek text currently in vogue have the Indicative here (‘we will bear’), almost all versions so read. But over 80% of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, have the Subjunctive, which I have followed. It is not automatic; it is up to us."}

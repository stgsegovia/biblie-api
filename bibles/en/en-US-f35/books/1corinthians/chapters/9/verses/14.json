{"verse":"14","text":"So also the Lord has instructed those who proclaim the Gospel to live from the Gospel.When was that? When Jesus sent out the twelve and later the seventy, He told them not to take money but to depend on the hospitality of those to whom they ministered. Later on, however, He reversed that instruction, but “to live” refers to basic needs, not luxury."}

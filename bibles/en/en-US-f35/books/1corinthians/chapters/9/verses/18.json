{"verse":"18","text":"So what is my reward? That when I evangelize I may present the Gospel of ChristPerhaps 4% of the Greek manuscripts omit “of Christ”, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc. without charge, so as not to use my rights in the Gospel.If you only do something because you are compelled, because you can't get out of it, you get no credit for it. Paul preaches the Gospel because he has to, he is compelled, so gets no credit. But Paul wants some credit, some reward! So how can he get it? Not by preaching, since that is obligatory—by preaching without charge! Paul has the right to charge but foregoes it so as to get some credit/reward. Evidently this was rather important to him (verse 15)—I confess that I don't understand why he said it would be better to die."}

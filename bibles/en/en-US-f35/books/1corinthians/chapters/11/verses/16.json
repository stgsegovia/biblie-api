{"verse":"16","text":"But if anyone decides to be contentious, neither we nor the congregations of God have any other practice.Back in verse 2 above Paul mentions ‘traditions’, and traditions are not the same as commandments. To disobey God's commands is sin, but what of disobeying a tradition? The impression I gain is that disobeying a tradition is not sin, although it does have consequences."}

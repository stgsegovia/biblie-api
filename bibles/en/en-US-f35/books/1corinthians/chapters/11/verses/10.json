{"verse":"10","text":"—for this reason the woman needs to have authority upon her head, because of the angelsI believe verse ten constitutes an aside that derives from verse nine, not from verses five and six. The general practice in the versions of adding ‘symbol of’ before ‘authority’ is unwarranted, and does damage to the Text. The woman was created for the man, but since there are no female angels, the angels are very fascinated by the female of our species (remember Genesis 6). For this reason women need the protection of male authority. (Those feminists who peremptorily reject any semblance of male authority are just asking for a demon, and what little demon is going to object?)—"}

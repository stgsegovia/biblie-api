{"verse":"6","text":"So if a woman does not cover herself, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.This does not make for very popular teaching nowadays, but there it is. But is it “shameful” before God, or before men? If only before men, it is not sin."}

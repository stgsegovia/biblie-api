{"verse":"30","text":"Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a good many have died.Ever since the Flood the Creator has imposed and exacted the death penalty for those who shed innocent blood (Genesis 9:5-6). There are dozens of passages in the Old Testament that deal with the theme of blood guiltiness. Here are a few: Genesis 21:12, “shall surely be put to death”; Exodus 21:14, a murderer was even to be dragged away from the altar and killed; Numbers 35:31, “you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, …he shall surely be put to death”; 2 Kings 24:4, “he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the Lord would not pardon”. Here in verses 27 and 30 Paul says that God had killed ‘a good many’ because they were ‘guilty of the blood of the Lord’. Romans 1:32, written decades after Pentecost, affirms that murderers are still deserving of death. We all need the shed blood of God's Lamb for cleansing from sin, but please do not take it lightly!"}

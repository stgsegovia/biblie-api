{"verse":"16","text":"The cup of blessing that we bless,Those officiating bless the ‘cup’, which then blesses those who partake. Yes, to partake worthily brings blessing. is it not a sharing of the blood of Christ?Although one finds it difficult to agree with the Roman doctrine of transubstantiation, that the words of the one officiating transform the wine into literal blood, Paul evidently takes a very serious view of the ‘Lord's Table’. It is not a mere symbolism. The bread that we break, is it not a sharing of the body of Christ?“The body of Christ” here refers to His physical body on the cross, just as “the blood of Christ” refers to His blood shed on the cross."}

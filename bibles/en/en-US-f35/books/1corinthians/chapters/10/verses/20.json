{"verse":"20","text":"Rather, that the things pagans sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to become participants with the demons.Obviously demons exist. The visible idols represent invisible demons. When you worship an idol you subordinate yourself to its demon. There are ‘idols’ that are not physical images."}

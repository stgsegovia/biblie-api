{"verse":"31","text":"Therefore, whether you eat or you drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.Here is a basic principle that furnishes us with the key for deciding about doubtful things, and things produced by modern technology that are not mentioned in the Bible. If I want to go watch a movie, I should ask myself, “Why do I want to do this? Is it for the glory of God?” If I want to buy a new, super-duper cell phone, I should ask the same questions. If we really want to please God, we will give an honest answer and act accordingly."}

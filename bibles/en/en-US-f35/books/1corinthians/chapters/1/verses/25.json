{"verse":"25","text":"because the ‘foolishness’ of God is wiser than men, and the ‘weakness’ of God is stronger than men.We like to forget this, but it is best not to do so. Arrogant servants of Satan often use stronger terms than ‘foolishness’—they will use ‘repugnant’, ‘ridiculous’, ‘intolerable’, etc."}

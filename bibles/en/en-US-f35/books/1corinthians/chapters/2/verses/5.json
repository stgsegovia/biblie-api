{"verse":"5","text":"so that your faith not be in men's wisdom, but in God's power.How many missionaries and pastors today are following Paul's example? How many of us know how to demonstrate God's power? Faith is to be based on power, not human wisdom. If we don't know how to use God's power, we had better cry out to Him until we learn how. Certain theological systems virtually condemn their adherents to never use God's power."}

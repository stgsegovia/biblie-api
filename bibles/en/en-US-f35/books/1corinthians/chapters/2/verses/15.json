{"verse":"15","text":"But he who is spiritual evaluates everything, while not being himself subject to anyone's judgment.The same verb is used three times, to which I have given different renderings—‘discerned’, ‘evaluates’, ‘subject to judgment’ (the middle one is in the active voice, the other two in the passive). The king of interpretation is the context, and the verb (ανακρινω) covers a considerable semantic area."}

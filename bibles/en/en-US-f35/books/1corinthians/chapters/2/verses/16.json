{"verse":"16","text":"For “who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him?”See Isaiah 40:13. Compare John 3:8, where the Lord Jesus says that the Spirit controlled person is like the wind, unpredictable—other people will have trouble figuring him out; when they expect him to ‘zig’, he will ‘zag’. But we have the mind of Christ.Well now, do we or don't we? How many people do you know who think like Jesus did?"}

{"verse":"17","text":"If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; because God's temple, which you are, is holy.This passage contrasts with 6:19; there each individual believer is a temple of the Holy Spirit, while here the local congregation is stated to be God's temple, with the Holy Spirit indwelling the members. Note that God does not take kindly to any effort to damage His temple."}

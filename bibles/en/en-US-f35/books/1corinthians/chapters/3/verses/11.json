{"verse":"11","text":"for no one can lay any foundation other than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.I would say that the primary reference here is to leaders of local congregations, who need to be careful how they ‘build’ God's ‘house’. But I believe it also clearly applies to anyone whose personal life is based on Jesus Christ. Each of us will give an account of how we built our lives on that foundation. Note that we are not offered the option of changing the foundation. Anyone who attempts to do so does not belong to God."}

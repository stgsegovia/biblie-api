{"verse":"5","text":"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and expose the motives of the hearts.Part of judging correctly is knowing why the accused did it. Since ‘knowing the motives of the hearts’ is generally beyond us [even our own at times], we had better leave the judging up to the Judge. At that time the praise that comes to each will be from God.I was brought up on the AV that says: “then shall every man have praise of God”, which led me to believe that everyone would get some praise. However, I believe the Text says something different, as indicated in my rendering. Paul is not affirming that all will get praise (of what use is ‘praise’ to someone in the Lake of fire?), but that the Judge will distribute whatever praise is merited."}

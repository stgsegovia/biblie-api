Since ‘knowing the motives of the hearts’ is generally beyond us [even our own at times], we had better leave the judging up to the Judge. At that time the praise that comes to each will be from God.I was brought up on the AV that says: “then shall every man have praise of God”, which led me to believe that everyone would get some praise. However, I believe the Text says something different, as indicated in my rendering. Paul is not affirming that all will get praise (of what use is ‘praise’ to someone in the Lake of fire?), but that the Judge will distribute whatever praise is merited."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"4","verse":"6","text":"I have illustrated these things using myself and Apollos, brothers, for your sakes, so that you may learn from us not to think beyond what is written,Written where?

Or what do you have that you did not receive?Here is the fundamental recipe against boasting. None of us chose who our parents would be, where we would be born, what language would be our native tongue. But these circumstances dictate the opportunities that a person will have, quite apart from talents and abilities. Things that were given to us do not form a proper basis for boasting. So if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?"},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"4","verse":"8","text":"You are already stuffed! You are already rich!

We have been made as the refuse of the world, the off-scouring of whatever, to this moment.Wow, what a ‘job description’! Any applicants? How many of the plague of self-styled ‘apostles’ in our day meet these qualifications? We need to understand what Paul is saying here. To be looked down on and criticized by believers among whom one has labored is one thing. Local people with personal ambition know how to do that. For God to make us “as the refuse of the world” is something very different. How should we understand this? If we insist on proclaiming a ‘gospel’ that the world considers to be stupid, abject foolishness, we will certainly be ridiculed. But if we insist on biblical values that the world has declared to be ‘hate crimes’, we will certainly be hated and persecuted, treated as refuse. The choice of Hebrews 13:13 is upon us: “So then, let us go out to Him, outside the camp, bearing His disgrace.”"},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"4","verse":"14","text":"I am not writing these things to shame you; I am admonishing you as my dear children."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"4","verse":"15","text":"Because even if you were to have thousands of tutors in Christ, you would not have many fathers, because I am the one who begot you in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"4","verse":"16","text":"Therefore I am urging you, become my imitators.Our spiritual children will naturally look to us for example.

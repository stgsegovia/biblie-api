Hey, I think I would get up and run away as fast and as far as I could! I see two miracles here: 1) He knocked them down with His word; 2) He obliged them to stay there and get on with their job, because it was the appointed time for Him to be taken, tried and crucified.

Caiaphas was the political high priest (that year), for purposes of dealing with Rome. who was high priest that year.A careful look at the parallel accounts makes clear that all of Peter's denials took place at Caiaphas' palace, as also all the recorded questionings, etc. So between verses 13 and 15 Jesus is taken to Caiaphas (see verse 24 below)."},{"book":"John","chapter":"18","verse":"14","text":"(Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.)"},{"book":"John","chapter":"18","verse":"15","text":"Now Simon Peter kept following Jesus, as also the other disciple.

The use of parenthetical comments, or historical/cultural asides, is standard procedure for John; for a partial list see: 1:44, 2:6, 4:2,9,44, 6:4,64, 7:50, 9:14, 11:2,18-19,30-31, 12:1,6,16, 13:2,11,28-29 (there are at least a dozen more).

So they said to him, “You aren't one of His disciples too, are you?”We don't know what John was doing all this time, except that he was right there in that compound; I think it perfectly likely that he would talk to Peter from time to time. They knew that John was a disciple, but did not know Peter. Also, the windows of the house were doubtless open (no air conditioning), so they probably heard Caiaphas ask about His disciples. Actually, Luke 22:61 says Jesus turned and looked at Peter, so the window had to be open, and Jesus was near the window but with His back to it. Since Caiaphas was presumably facing Jesus he was also facing the open window and his voice would certainly carry out to the patio. Their question was not unreasonable.

A close comparison of all the details surrounding the denials (who provoked it, in what terms, when, where, Peter's response) shows that there had to be a minimum of six, more likely eight, denials—3/4 before the first rooster crow, 3/4 before the second. Peter was being satanized (Luke 22:31), and it took a look from the Lord to break the spell (Luke 22:61)."},{"book":"John","chapter":"18","verse":"28","text":"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning.

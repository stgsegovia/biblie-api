{"verse":"27","text":"At that point His disciples arrived, and they were amazed that He was talking with a woman; yet no one said, “What do you want?”A number of versions capitalize the ‘You’, as if the question would have been directed to Jesus, but it seems more likely to me that this first question would have been to the woman. or “Why are You talking with her?”"}

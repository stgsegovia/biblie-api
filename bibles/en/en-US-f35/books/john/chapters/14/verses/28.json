{"verse":"28","text":"“You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me you would have been glad that I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ because my Father is greater than I.How does that work? Well, if you really love someone you are more concerned for their well-being than you are for your own. For Jesus to return to the Father would certainly be better for Him. (And because He sent the Holy Spirit it also became better for them, and for us.)"}

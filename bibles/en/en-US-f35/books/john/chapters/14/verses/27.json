{"verse":"27","text":"“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you; it is not like the world gives that I give to you.The world can offer peace of a sort, for a time, with a price tag, but it's an illusion. Do not let your heart be distressed or intimidated.Satan will certainly use the world to try to intimidate and distress us, but how we react is up to us. We can decide to “let the peace of God rule in our hearts” (Colossians 3:15)."}

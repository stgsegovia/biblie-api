{"verse":"10","text":"Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own; rather it is the Father who dwells in me who does the works.Notice again the close connection between saying and doing—“I speak… the Father does”. If, like Jesus (John 12:49-50), we only speak what the Father says, He will act on the basis of our word too."}

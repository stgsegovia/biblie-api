{"verse":"13","text":"Further, whatever you (pl) may ask in my name,In verse 12 the verb ‘will do’ is singular, both times, so it has to do with the individual. Here, ‘you may ask’ is plural, reminiscent of Matthew 18:19-20. To ask “in Jesus' name” is to ask something Jesus would ask, or is asking (remember John 12:49-50)—notice that the purpose is to glorify the Father (or more precisely, that the Father be glorified in/through the Son), not to satisfy any selfish wish we may have. that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son."}

{"verse":"6","text":"Jesus says to him: â€œI am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one goes to the Father except through me.Jesus answers both questions: He is the way, and He is going to the Father. The only way that any human being, including Adam and Eve and all the Old Testament saints, can go to the Father is on the basis of the shed blood of the Lamb of God."}

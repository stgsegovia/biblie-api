{"verse":"16","text":"Also,I take it that verse 16 is parallel to verse 13, and both are tied to verse 12. I will ask the Father and He will give you another Enabler,Greek has two words for ‘another’, another of the same kind and another of a different kind. Here it is another of the same kind—being two members of the Trinity, the Son and the Holy Spirit are definitely of the ‘same’ kind! so that He may stay with you throughout the ageStrictly, ‘into the age’; ‘age’ is singular, and for the meaning ‘forever’ we would expect the plural, ‘into the ages’. I doubt that the Lord is promising that the Holy Spirit will remain in us (see next verse) throughout eternity, just during this age. During this age we need the Holy Spirit in us to counteract the ‘flesh’ or fallen nature; in Heaven we will be free of all contaminants."}

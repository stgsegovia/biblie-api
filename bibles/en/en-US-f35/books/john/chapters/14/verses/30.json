{"verse":"30","text":"“I will no longer talk much with you, because the ruler of the world is approaching;Like Jesus said a few hours later to the soldiers in the garden, “this is your hour, and the power of darkness” (Luke 22:53). Satan was ‘approaching’ to do his thing, to perform his part in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus. actually, he has nothing in me.This is important! Satan had absolutely no hold on Jesus. At no time had Jesus done anything that could give Satan a finger hold or toehold in His life. Whenever we sin we give Satan such a hold—and the oftener we repeat a given sin the stronger that hold becomes, until it becomes a stronghold. If we confess and reject the sin, such a hold can be broken, through the power of the Holy Spirit."}

{"verse":"2","text":"In my Father's house are many dwellings‘House’ and ‘dwelling’ translate different words. I suppose that “my Father's house” is a synonym for Heaven. (otherwise I would have told you).You can find quite a variety of interpretations and translations of this clause. I assume that the Lord had certainly given them teaching on the subject of Heaven; He here assures them that if their expectations were false He would have warned them. I take it that over 95% of the Greek manuscripts do not have “that” introducing the next clause. I am going away to prepare a place for you."}

{"verse":"44","text":"How can you believe, who receive glory from menHere I follow what I consider to be by far the best line of transmission, although attested by less than 30% of the Greek manuscripts. and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?This is serious! Apparently one's attitude toward glory affects his ability to believe. If the approval of people is more important to you than the approval of God, you probably will not believe into Jesus."}

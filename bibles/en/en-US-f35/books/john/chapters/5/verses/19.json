{"verse":"19","text":"Then Jesus answered and said to them: “Most assuredly I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, except something He sees the Father doing; because whatever things He does, precisely these the Son also does.I find this statement to be amazing, revealing and challenging. Jesus only did what He saw the Father doing; so how about us? I would say that my main ‘ministry’ problem is that I often don't know what the Father is doing, and so I waste a lot of time and effort."}

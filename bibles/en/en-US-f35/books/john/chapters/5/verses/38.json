{"verse":"38","text":"Nor do you have His word abiding in you,The Lord declares their spiritual bankruptcy. For a religious leader to have never heard God's voice is pretty poor, but much worse is to study God's Word without its ever finding a place in your heart. because you do not believe on the very one whom He sent."}

{"verse":"13","text":"But the man who was cured did not know who it was, because Jesus had disappeared, there being a crowd in the place.Let's stop and think about what Jesus did here. There were probably hundreds of sick people there—why did He only heal one of them? And why did He disappear into the crowd before the man could find out who He was? And why did He do this on a Sabbath? I think it was all deliberate—He wanted to provoke the Jews. He chose a Sabbath; He chose a man who had a pallet, but who had no slave or other helper; He commanded (yes, commanded) the man to carry the pallet; He got out of the way so the Jews would have the man to themselves. In this way He set up a confrontation, as we will see below. [In passing we may note that if ever there was a ‘divine healer’ it was the Lord Jesus, and yet He did not empty out this ‘hospital’. Maybe divine healers aren't supposed to empty hospitals.]"}

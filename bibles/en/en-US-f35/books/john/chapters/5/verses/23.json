{"verse":"23","text":"so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father.Of course someone who does not honor the Father will not honor the Son either. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.I take it that the Lord Jesus is saying that monotheistic people (Jews, Muslims) who claim to honor the Father, but do not honor the Son, are not really doing so. (Perhaps that would not apply to those who have never heard about Jesus.)"}

{"verse":"16","text":"So because of this the Jews began persecuting Jesus and trying to kill Him,Less than 3% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit “and trying to kill Him” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.The last recorded events before John 5:1 are in Luke 5:12-39. The healing of the paralytic had impressed the Jews, but then Jesus immediately went and ate with publicans; and verses 36-39 were against what the Jews represented. Here in John Jesus challenges their authority over the Sabbath."}

{"verse":"17","text":"So the servant girl, the doorkeeper, says to Peter, “You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?”Everyone there, including the girl, knows that John belongs to Jesus, so her question is perfectly natural, without malice—she assumes that Peter must also. Notice that Peter denies right in front of John! Don't you know that John kept his eye on Peter from that moment on! He says, “I am not!”"}

{"verse":"25","text":"Well Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You aren't one of His disciples too, are you?”We don't know what John was doing all this time, except that he was right there in that compound; I think it perfectly likely that he would talk to Peter from time to time. They knew that John was a disciple, but did not know Peter. Also, the windows of the house were doubtless open (no air conditioning), so they probably heard Caiaphas ask about His disciples. Actually, Luke 22:61 says Jesus turned and looked at Peter, so the window had to be open, and Jesus was near the window but with His back to it. Since Caiaphas was presumably facing Jesus he was also facing the open window and his voice would certainly carry out to the patio. Their question was not unreasonable. So he denied it and said, “I am not!”"}

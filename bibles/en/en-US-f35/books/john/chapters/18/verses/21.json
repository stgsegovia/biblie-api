{"verse":"21","text":"Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. Sure, they know what I said.”The Lord's observation here was perfectly reasonable and in accord with the law. The priest should have produced witnesses, rather than asking Jesus to testify against Himself."}

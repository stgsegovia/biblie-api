{"verse":"6","text":"So when He said to them, “I am he,” they went backward and fell to the ground!Have you ever tried to imagine this scene? Try imagining that you are one those soldiers, and the person you have been sent to arrest knocks you down, just with his word! So are you going to want to try anything against him, really? Hey, I think I would get up and run away as fast and as far as I could! I see two miracles here: 1) He knocked them down with His word; 2) He obliged them to stay there and get on with their job, because it was the appointed time for Him to be taken, tried and crucified. But He made it perfectly clear that He was in control of the situation."}

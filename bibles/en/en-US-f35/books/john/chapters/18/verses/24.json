{"verse":"24","text":"(Annas had sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.)The eclectic text, following about 9% of the Greek manuscripts, reads “then Annas sent…”, creating a conflict with the parallel passages (perhaps 1% read “but Annas sent/had sent…”). The use of parenthetical comments, or historical/cultural asides, is standard procedure for John; for a partial list see: 1:44, 2:6, 4:2,9,44, 6:4,64, 7:50, 9:14, 11:2,18-19,30-31, 12:1,6,16, 13:2,11,28-29 (there are at least a dozen more). I take it that verse 24 here is just one more instance; it is as if at this point John realizes that the reader could think that the proceedings were still going on at Annas' house."}

{"verse":"28","text":"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. They themselves did not enter the Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled but could eat the Passover.Aren't these guys cute? They are perpetrating a totally illegal and immoral plot, but they think they are squeaky clean, no problemâ€”but to set foot in the Praetorium, now that would be dirty! If your values are twisted, you are twisted."}

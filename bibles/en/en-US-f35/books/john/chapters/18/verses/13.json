{"verse":"13","text":"They took Him to Annas first, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas,The bigger reason was that Annas was the real high priest, according to the Law (the office of high priest was for life). He was the power behind the throne, so to say. Caiaphas was the political high priest (that year), for purposes of dealing with Rome. who was high priest that year.A careful look at the parallel accounts makes clear that all of Peter's denials took place at Caiaphas' palace, as also all the recorded questionings, etc. So between verses 13 and 15 Jesus is taken to Caiaphas (see verse 24 below)."}

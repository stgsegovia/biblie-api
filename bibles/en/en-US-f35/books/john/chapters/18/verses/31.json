{"verse":"31","text":"So Pilate said to them, “You take him and judge him according to your law.” So the Jews said to him, “We are not permitted to execute anyone.”Pilate was rubbing salt in their wound, reminding them that they were a subjugated people—he knew they wanted to kill Jesus, so when he tells them to judge Him he forces them to acknowledge their subjugation. (Roman governors were probably not appointed on the basis of being nice.)"}

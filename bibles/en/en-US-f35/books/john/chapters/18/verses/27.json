{"verse":"27","text":"So Peter denied again, and immediately a rooster crowed.In keeping with his usual procedure, John records three denials by Peter that are not mentioned by the other Evangelists, and I would say that the rooster crow here is the first of the two (Mark 14:68, 72). A close comparison of all the details surrounding the denials (who provoked it, in what terms, when, where, Peter's response) shows that there had to be a minimum of six, more likely eight, denialsâ€”3/4 before the first rooster crow, 3/4 before the second. Peter was being satanized (Luke 22:31), and it took a look from the Lord to break the spell (Luke 22:61)."}

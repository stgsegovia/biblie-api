{"verse":"34","text":"The people answered Him: “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah remains forever; and so how can you say, ‘The Son of the Man must be lifted up’? Who is this ‘the Son of the Man’?”I find it interesting that the people were evidently equating ‘the Son of the Man’ with the Messiah, which was precisely correct; but what Jesus was saying did not match their expectations."}

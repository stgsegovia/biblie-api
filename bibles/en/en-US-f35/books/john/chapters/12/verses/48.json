{"verse":"48","text":"The one who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has that which judges him—the word that I have spoken, that is what will judge him on the last day;‘Ignorance of the law is no excuse.’ If the Bible exists in your language and you know how to read (or you know someone who can read), then you could have learned Jesus' sayings. Claiming that you did not know will not hack it."}

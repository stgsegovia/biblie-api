{"verse":"26","text":"If anyone would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, my servant will be too.If we want to be where Jesus is, we need to stick close to Him. (Well, you know, that's really kind of obvious, but how many of us do it?) Further, if anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.Each underlined pronoun corresponds to an emphatic pronoun in the Original Text. What the Lord did here was quite unusual; in other places He emphasized one pronoun, but not five in a row, and especially with all five referring to Himself! So what was He trying to tell us? I take it that He is telling us to focus on HIM, his person and our relationship to Him. He needs to be number one, without competition. He is talking about total commitment, but not without recompense—“the Father will honor him.”"}

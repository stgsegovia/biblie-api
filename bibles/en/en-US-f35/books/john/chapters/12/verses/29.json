{"verse":"29","text":"So the crowd that was standing by and listening said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.”It seems clear that the bystanders did not hear the words, at least not to distinguish them; they heard the Voice, which must have been impressive (they compared it to thunder). A similar thing happened on the road to Damascus; only Paul understood the words."}

{"verse":"31","text":"Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be thrown out.“Thrown out” as ruler of this world; upon Christ's victory through the cross and the resurrection Satan was deposed. Satan continues to carry on as if he were still the ruler, but he is acting on the basis of bluff and usurpation. If Christ is now the true and legitimate ruler of this world, why is Satan allowed to carry on? The Father is ‘seeking’ those who will worship Him in spirit and truth, not because it is easy or convenient. So there has to be testing, there has to be an adverse context; so no one can claim that God is ‘buying votes’ (which was Satan's allegation about Job)."}

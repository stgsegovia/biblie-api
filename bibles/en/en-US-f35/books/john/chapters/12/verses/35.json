{"verse":"35","text":"Then Jesus said to them: “The Light will be with you just a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you;Since most people did their traveling on foot, they would understand this principle very well—you need to make as much distance as you can while there is light. the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going."}

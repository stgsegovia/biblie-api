{"verse":"50","text":"And I know that His command is eternal life. So whatever I say, I say it just like the Father told me.”In John 5:19 Jesus affirms that he only did what He saw the Father do. Here He affirms that He only said what He heard the Father say. Although the Father and the Son are distinct persons, as Jesus repeatedly made clear, His identification with the Father was so complete that to see Him was to see the Father, to believe into Him was to believe into the Father (verses 44-45, above)."}

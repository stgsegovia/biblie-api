{"verse":"23","text":"But Jesus answered them saying: “The hour has come for the Son of the Man to be glorified.The impression one gets is that Jesus did not address the Greeks directly, but I wonder if they didn't sort of tag along and thus were within earshot. We know that the Lord could read thoughts, and so He would know what they really wanted—I assume that what they wanted did not fit in the Plan at that point. However, if the Greeks were within range, verses 24-26 would be for them just as much as for anyone else."}

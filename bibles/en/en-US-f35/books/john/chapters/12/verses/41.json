{"verse":"41","text":"Isaiah said these things whenLess than 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, read “because” instead of “when” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). The difference in meaning is significant. he saw His gloryWait a minute! Whom did Isaiah see? John is talking about Jesus, so when did Isaiah see Jesus? The quote in verse 40 is from Isaiah 6:10. The quoted words were spoken by Jehovah, verse 8, the One who was sitting on the throne, verse 1. In verse 5 Isaiah says of Him, “my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts”. So John is affirming that the One on the throne was Jehovah the Son, Jesus. I love it! and spoke concerning Him."}

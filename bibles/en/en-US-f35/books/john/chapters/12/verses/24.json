{"verse":"24","text":"Most assuredly I say to you, if a grain of wheat, having fallen into the ground, does not die, it remains alone;Once a seed is planted, if it doesn't germinate it rots, and is wasted, but the germinating process destroys the seed, it ‘dies’. How this applies to us is developed in the next verse. but if it dies it bears a lot of fruit.Jehovah the Son had ‘fallen to the ground’ some 34 years before, but now He was going to die—the ‘fruit’ is still being produced!"}

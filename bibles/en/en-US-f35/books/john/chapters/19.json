One would have been enough (it was customary to put the crime over the victim's head). I take it that Pilate was not happy, having been bested by the Jews; and as I have said above, I think he was personally convinced that Jesus was a king.

Since sour wine was not used at the Passover, this does not conflict with the Lord's statement in the upper room (Matthew 26:29) that He would not drink of “this product of the vine”. All four Evangelists mention the sour wine. There was evidently a pot/vessel full of it (the soldiers were in for many hours of vigil and that was what they drank). The mocking offer mentioned in Luke 23:36 happened before the darkness; the other three accounts after. The offer recorded in Matthew 27:48 and Mark 15:36 was triggered by Jesus' cry, “My God, my God…” The one in John 19:29-30 by His saying, “I am thirsty”. I venture to suggest that there was an interval between His despairing cry and His statement—after the cry He may have lapsed back into silence for a bit; He was trying to make contact with the Father. It may be that the sour wine sort of ‘wet His whistle’ so He could let out His shout of victory. the sour wine, Jesus said, “Paid in full!!”Matthew, Mark and Luke all affirm that Jesus gave a great shout, but without giving the content. I take it that John supplies that information, although he does not mention that it was a shout. “Τετελεσται”—that was what they wrote on bills and promissory notes when they were paid off = ‘paid in full’. When something is shouted the individual sounds can be distorted, but John was right there and could read His lips, if necessary. It was a shout of victory: “We did it!” “Finished!” “Paid in full!” And bowing His head He dismissed His spirit.That is right—the cross did not kill Jesus, He just told His spirit to leave. In John 10:17-18 he was very clear: no one could take His life from Him, but He could lay it down (please see the note at John 10:18)."},{"book":"John","chapter":"19","verse":"31","text":"Now then, because it was Preparation Day, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews requested Pilate that their legs might be broken and they be removed."},{"book":"John","chapter":"19","verse":"32","text":"Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been crucified with Him."},{"book":"John","chapter":"19","verse":"33","text":"But upon coming to Jesus, they did not break His legs, since they saw that He had already died."},{"book":"John","chapter":"19","verse":"34","text":"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out."},{"book":"John","chapter":"19","verse":"35","text":"And the one who saw has testified,John, the author of this Gospel, was right there (verses 25-26 above), so he could see very clearly what came out of Jesus' side—that the blood had separated was a clear sign of physical death.

The body of an executed criminal would normally be treated ignominiously, and I imagine that was what the high priests intended, but the Father made sure that the Son received an honorable burial. Matthew 27:60 informs us that Joseph had himself prepared that tomb, and he did so at a spot near Golgotha.

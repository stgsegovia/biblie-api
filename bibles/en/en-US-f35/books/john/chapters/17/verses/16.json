{"verse":"16","text":"They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.He repeats what He just said in verse 14, so it must be important. Jesus was not of this world because He literally came from Heaven, which could not be said of those disciples. But in the context of verse 15 the reference is probably to the ‘world’ dominated by Satan, the system. Their allegiance is no longer to Satan's system."}

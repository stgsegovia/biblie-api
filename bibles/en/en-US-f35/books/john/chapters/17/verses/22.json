{"verse":"22","text":"In fact, the glory that You gave to me I have given to them,What ‘glory’ was that? In Romans 3:23 I imagine that the ‘glory’ of God has to do with His essence, His character. The new ‘man’ or nature that a regenerated person receives is related to that essence/character. It is that nature in common that makes us ‘one’. However, since most Christians seldom allow the new nature to control them, in practice we don't see all that much unity. But in Heaven it will come to fruition. so that they may be one just as We are one:"}

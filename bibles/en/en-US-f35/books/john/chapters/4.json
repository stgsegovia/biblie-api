It was about 6 p.m.Since John elsewhere always uses Roman time, I assume that he does so here as well. The Text has “the sixth hour”. Many versions put “noon”, which reflects Jewish time. But the Text says Jesus was worn out, which agrees better with a full day's walk than with a half day's walk. The distance between Salem and Sychar was probably about 35 miles, as the crow flies, but since the whole distance was over accidented terrain, the walking distance would be a good deal more. They had walked some 50 miles in twelve hours. Like the Text says, He was tired! And He was hot and thirsty.

In verse 15 the woman sees only the physical sense. I personally do not find the spiritual meaning to be transparent. I have been serving the Lord for many years, but still experience spiritual thirst. I have to keep drinking. However, the ‘water’ being the Holy Spirit, any thirst will not be for lack of ‘water’. rather, the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water, welling up into eternal life.”That is what the Text says, “into eternal life”. Eternal life is a quality of life, more precisely a life in communion with the Father. The picture is not necessarily of a geyser, water spouting up, but there has to be a constant flow. As our capacity increases the flow should also increase. Of course the water must be shared with others, or we become stagnant."},{"book":"John","chapter":"4","verse":"15","text":"The woman says to Him, “Sir, give me this water! so that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”"},{"book":"John","chapter":"4","verse":"16","text":"Jesus says to her, “Go, call your husband and come back here.”"},{"book":"John","chapter":"4","verse":"17","text":"The woman answered and said, “I don't have a husband.” Jesus says to her: “You stated correctly that you do not have a husband,"},{"book":"John","chapter":"4","verse":"18","text":"because you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is no husband of yours.

Really, because the Father is looking for such people to worship Him.The Father “is looking” for those who will worship Him in spirit and truth. It may be that we have here a window on the reason why God created a race such as ours—persons in His image with the capacity to choose. God “is looking” for something, which means He does not have it, at least not automatically, nor in sufficient quantity. I take it that He wants to be appreciated for who He is, but to have meaning such appreciation cannot come from robots—it has to be voluntary. So He created a type of being with that capacity, but He had to take the risk that such a being would choose not to appreciate Him. Unfortunately, most human beings make the negative choice, and with that negative choice come all sorts of negative consequences. Ever since Adam humans are born with an inclination toward sin, so for someone to choose to appreciate God is definitely not automatic, nor even easy. No one can reasonably accuse God of having ‘stacked the deck’ in His own favor, of ‘buying votes’—He seems to have done just the opposite. If a human being, against his natural inclination, chooses to appreciate God, then He receives what He is looking for. “In spirit and truth” presumably means that it cannot be faked, cannot be forced, cannot be merely physical, cannot be merely emotional (though both body and emotions can, and often will, be utilized)."},{"book":"John","chapter":"4","verse":"24","text":"God is Spirit,Again the lack of the definite article presents us with an ambiguity; the rendering ‘a spirit’ is possible.

Well, what do you suppose he did when he got to land, since he obviously got there well before the others. From verse 12 I gather that Peter had not ventured to speak.

So he welcomes a chance to do something and jumps up when Jesus asks for fish. and dragged the net onto the land, full of one hundred and fifty-three large fish [!]; and although being so many, the net was not torn.Like, wow!

The only other option that I see would be that Jesus asked if Peter loved Him more than he loved his colleagues.

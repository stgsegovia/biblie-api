{"verse":"34","text":"You will look for me and not find me; also, where I am you cannot come.”“Where I am”—that is what the Text says. I imagine that the idea is the same as in John 3:13, “who is in Heaven”. He has just said in verse 33 that He is going back to Heaven. So, He is telling those Jewish leaders that they cannot go to Heaven!"}

{"verse":"17","text":"If anyone wants to do His will,If we want to do, we will know. The Lord did not say, if we just want to knowâ€”we have to be committed to obey before we know what the order is. Once we are committed to obey, it is in God's own interest to talk to us. he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is from God or whether I am speaking on my own."}

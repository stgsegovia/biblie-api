{"verse":"42","text":"Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?‚ÄùI smell a rat. In verse 27 above they claimed that no one knew where the Christ was coming from; now here they say it is Beth-lehem. I suspect that there were people planted in the crowd whose job it was to create confusion, and they felt no obligation to tell the truth."}

{"verse":"8","text":"You guys go up to this feast; I am not going up yetPerhaps 3% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit “yet” (as in NASB, TEV, RSV, etc.). The reading of the so-called ‘critical’ text has the effect of ascribing a falsehood to Jesus, since He did in fact go to the feast (and doubtless knew what He was going to do). Among the 97% are 𝕻66,75 and B—since the UBS editors usually attach the highest value to 𝕻75 and B, isn't it strange that they reject them in this case? to this feast, because my time has not yet fully come.”"}

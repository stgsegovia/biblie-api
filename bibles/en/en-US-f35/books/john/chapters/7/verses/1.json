{"verse":"1","text":"After these things Jesus continued to move about in Galilee,All of chapter six took place in Galilee, so why make a point of Jesus' continuing there? 6:4 says that the Passover was near, but 7:2 says that the Feast of Tabernacles was nearâ€”that is six months later. As a God-fearing male, Jesus had to go to Jerusalem for the Passover, so He must have gone, although none of the Gospels records it. I take it that He went without calling attention to Himself, and returned immediately to Galilee, for the reason given in the second half of the verse. since He did not wish to move about in Judea because the Jews were wanting to kill Him.Between 6:71 and 7:2 six months elapsed. For events that occurred during that period see Matthew 15:1-18:35, Mark 7:1-9:50 and Luke 9:18-50."}

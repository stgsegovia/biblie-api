{"verse":"29","text":"I do know Him because I am from Him, and He sent me.”The Lord is very emphatic about His heavenly origin. Of course the Jews want to be rid of Him because He most definitely is not fitting into their scheme of things. I take it that there is divine intervention at work so they are not able to arrest Him."}

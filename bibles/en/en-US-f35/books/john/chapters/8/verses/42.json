{"verse":"42","text":"So Jesus said to them: “If God were your Father, you would love me, because I came forth from God and I am here.As John will write later, “he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?” (1 John 4:20). So anyone who loved the Father (not having seen Him) would certainly love the Son who was physically present and visible. Jesus keeps reiterating His divine origin. Further, I have not come on my own, but He sent me."}

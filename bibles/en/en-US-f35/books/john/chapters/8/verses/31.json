{"verse":"31","text":"So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed Him: “If you abide in my word, you really are my disciples;So what happens if we don't abide in His Word? And how can you abide in something that doesn't exist (for you)? There are still thousands of languages spoken in the world that do not have even one verse of the Bible translated into them. How can speakers of such languages be true disciples of Jesus? I have actually heard some who claim they have been ‘baptized in the Spirit’ say they don't need the Bible, because the Holy Spirit speaks to them directly. Now why would the Holy Spirit speak to someone who disagrees with the Lord Jesus? In this connection, notice especially John 16:14-15."}

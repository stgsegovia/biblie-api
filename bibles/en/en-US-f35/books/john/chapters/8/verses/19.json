{"verse":"19","text":"Then they said to Him, “Where is your father?”Their question is reasonable. Since Jesus is adducing His Father as a witness they want to know where they can find Him, to confirm the witness. But Jesus does not give a direct answer, as He usually did not, when dealing with Pharisees. Jesus answered: “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me you would also know my Father.”"}

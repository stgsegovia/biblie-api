{"verse":"35","text":"Now the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son does remain forever.A son becomes part of the genealogical record, a slave does not. Some versions capitalize “Son” here (as in the next verse), but I take it that Jesus is making a generic statement. However, in verse 36 it must be “Son”, because “make you free” is plural, referring to His hearers."}

{"verse":"51","text":"Most assuredly I say to you, if anyone should keep my word he will never ever see death.”The Lord is unusually emphatic here. He is evidently referring to spiritual death, but the Jews took it as referring to physical death. Notice that He said “keep my word”—again the emphasis is on commitment and obedience."}

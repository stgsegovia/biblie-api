{"verse":"44","text":"You are of your father the devil,1 John 3:8 makes clear that in fact Satan has lots of other ‘children’. and it is the desires of your father that you want to do. He was a murdererThey want to murder Jesus, showing thereby that they are worthy sons of their father. Satan instigated the death of the first couple, and may have influenced Cain to kill Abel. from the beginning and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him.If there is no truth in Satan then I conclude that it is impossible for him to tell the whole, undistorted truth. He may tell a partial truth, etc., but always with the intent to deceive. Whenever he speaks the lie he speaks from his own things, because he is a liar and the father of lying.So whenever we tell a lie we are doing Satan's thing. And whenever we accept a lie (like evolutionism, Marxism, Freudianism, humanism, relativism, etc.) we give Satan a foothold in our minds, which he usually turns into a stronghold."}

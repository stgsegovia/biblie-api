{"verse":"38","text":"On my part, I speak what I have observed with my Father, while on your part you do what you have observed with your father.”Jesus has affirmed several times that He could observe the Father, but in what sense could the Jews observe Satan? Our Lord's statement makes me curious. Perhaps the Jews were doing what they saw Satan doing (rather than seeing him physically). Some 10% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘heard from’ rather than “observed with”."}

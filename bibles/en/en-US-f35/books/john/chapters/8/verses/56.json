{"verse":"56","text":"Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day;What day was that? I suppose He is referring to the time that He, Jehovah the Son (the Angel of Jehovah), paid Abraham a personal visit. From the Record it is clear that Abraham knew very well that he was talking with Jehovah. Don't you know that was the high point in Abraham's life! Hey, just stop and think about what happened. yes, he saw it and rejoiced.‚Äù"}

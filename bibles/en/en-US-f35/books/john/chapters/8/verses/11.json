{"verse":"11","text":"So she said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said to her: “Neither do I condemn you.Jesus was not even a witness, and it required at least two witnesses to condemn; so of course He could not condemn her. But He makes clear that He does not condone her behavior. Go, and from now on don't sin any more!”"}

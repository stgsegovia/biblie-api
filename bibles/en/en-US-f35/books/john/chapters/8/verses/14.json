{"verse":"14","text":"Jesus answered and said to them: “Even though I testify about myself, my testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going.An interesting argument—why would His knowing His origin and destination validate His witness? I imagine that He is really referring to His identity; as God His witness is always valid. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going."}

{"verse":"24","text":"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins, because if you do not believe that I am,Most versions supply a ‘He’, making the phrase “I am He”; but the Text just has “I am”. Any Jew would immediately think of Jehovah calling Himself ‘I am’. Having just said that He was from Above, and not of this world, it seems to me clear that Jesus is claiming to be Jehovah—but they just do not want to get the point. you will die in your sins.”To “die in your sins” is to be spiritually lost. If they do not recognize Him as the Messiah, they are lost. They have already seen more than enough evidence, but have rejected it; since Jesus knows that they are not going to turn around, He states that they are lost. (Here it is ‘sins’ (pl) while in verse 21 it is ‘sin’ (sg); if a difference is intended I don't know what it is.)"}

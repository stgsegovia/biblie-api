{"verse":"12","text":"Then Jesus spoke to them again,“Them” refers to the crowd, and “again” means that He resumes His teaching after having been so rudely interrupted. The interruption occupies verses 3-11, so we are referred back to verse 2. saying: “I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk around in the darkness,“The darkness” = Satan's kingdom. but will have the light of the Life.”There is a certain secret society that requires a candidate to declare that he is coming out of darkness in search of light. A Christian who does this is formally denying Jesus."}

Assuming (for the sake of the argument) that the passage is spurious, how could it ever have intruded here, and to such effect that it is attested by some 85% of the MSS? Let's try to read the larger passage without these verses‚Äîwe must go from 7:52 to 8:12 directly. Reviewing the context, the chief priests and Pharisees had sent officers to arrest Jesus, to no avail; a ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô ensues; Nicodemus makes a point, to which the Pharisees answer: (7:52) ‚ÄúAre you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.‚Äù (8:12) Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, ‚ÄúI am the light of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù What is the antecedent of ‚Äúthem‚Äù, and what is the meaning of ‚Äúagain‚Äù? By the normal rules of grammar, if 7:53‚Äî8:11 is missing then ‚Äúthem‚Äù must refer to the ‚ÄúPharisees‚Äù and ‚Äúagain‚Äù means that there has already been at least one prior exchange. But, 7:45 makes clear that Jesus was not there with the Pharisees. Thus, UBS [the ‚Äòcritical‚Äô text] introduces an aberration. And yet, Metzger claims that the passage ‚Äúinterrupts the sequence of 7.52 and 8.12 ff.‚Äù (p. 220)! To look for the antecedents of 8:12 in 7:37-39 not only does despite to the syntax but also runs afoul of 8:13‚Äî‚Äúthe Pharisees‚Äù respond to Jesus' claim in verse 12, but ‚Äúthe Pharisees‚Äù are somewhere else, 7:45-52 (if the Pericope is absent). Metzger also claims that ‚Äúthe style and vocabulary of the pericope differ noticeably from the rest of the Fourth Gospel‚Äù‚Äîbut, would not the native speakers of Greek at that time have been in a better position than modern critics to notice something like that? So how could they allow such an ‚Äúextraneous‚Äù passage to be forced into the text? I submit that the evident answer is that they did not; it was there all the time. I also protest their use of brackets here. Since the editors clearly regard the passage to be spurious they should be consistent and delete it, as do NEB and Williams. That way the full extent of their error would be open for all to see. Unfortunately, NIV, NASB, NRSV, Berkeley and TEV also use brackets to question the legitimacy of this passage. But why was the story omitted? Leading church father and theologian, Augustine (about ad 430), answers: ‚ÄúCertain persons of little faith, or rather enemies of the true faith, fearing, I suppose, lest their wives should be given impunity in sinning, removed from their manuscripts the Lord's acts of forgiveness toward the adulteress, as if He who said ‚Äòsin no more‚Äô had granted permission to sin.‚Äù (See Augustine, ‚ÄúAdulterous Marriages‚Äù [2.7] trans. by Charles T. Huegelmeyer, in Saint Augustine: Treatises on Marriage and Other Subjects [New York: Fathers of the Church, 1955], p. 107.)

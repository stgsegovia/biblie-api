I can't prove it, but I imagine that the events recorded in Luke 18:18-19:27 (and the parallel passages in Matthew and Mark) occurred between verses 16 & 17, here.

It was obvious that He had not come when called, or He would have arrived several days sooner. She would conclude that He just didn't care that much. Since Jesus acted deliberately, it is clear that the Plan involved making the sisters go through that emotional suffering.

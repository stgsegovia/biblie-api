{"verse":"19","text":"(He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) And upon saying that He says to him, “Follow me!”The first time He said this to Peter had been 3½ years before, also on the shore of that lake [could it have been the same spot?]. Jesus renews His call. But Jesus actually starts walking away, and Peter follows Him (to be followed by John)."}

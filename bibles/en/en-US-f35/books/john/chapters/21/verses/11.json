{"verse":"11","text":"Simon Peter got upThat is what the Text says. Well, what do you suppose he did when he got to land, since he obviously got there well before the others. From verse 12 I gather that Peter had not ventured to speak. He is wet and therefore cold, and there is a fire. I bet he went straight to the fire and squatted down to warm himself, but he was too embarrassed to attempt a conversation. So he welcomes a chance to do something and jumps up when Jesus asks for fish. and dragged the net onto the land, full of one hundred and fifty-three large fish [!]; and although being so many, the net was not torn.Like, wow! They were evidently special fish, all large. But why 153? I do not know. The whole thing is supernatural, including the net not tearing."}

{"verse":"15","text":"So, when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”My first impression was that Jesus asked if Peter loved Him more than the others did, but Peter's answer does not seem to fit with that idea. My next impression would be that Jesus asked if Peter loved Him more than he loved the fish (and therefore, fishing), but His use of αγαπαω does not seem to fit. The only other option that I see would be that Jesus asked if Peter loved Him more than he loved his colleagues. He says to Him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I'm fond of you.”Jesus uses αγαπαω; Peter uses φιλεω. He says to him, “Feed my lambs.”"}

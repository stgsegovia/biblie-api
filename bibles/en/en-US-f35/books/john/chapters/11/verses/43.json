{"verse":"43","text":"Upon saying these things He shouted with a loud voice,That is what the Text says. Of course to shout is to use a loud voice, so the point seems to be that He really put His lungs into it—you could have heard Him a mile away! Well, Lazarus heard Him in Hades, which is in the middle of the earth somewhere (Matthew 12:40, Ephesians 4:9). Yes, but, could He not have done it with a whisper? I suppose so. So why did He yell? I do not know; I was not there. However, there may have been some symbolism involved—the longer one is dead the harder it is to bring him back. “Lazarus, come out!”As someone has said, if the Lord hadn't specified ‘Lazarus’ He might have emptied the graveyard!"}

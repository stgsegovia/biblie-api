{"verse":"33","text":"So when Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.Why? What troubled Him? He would not be inconsistent with Himself and His commitment to the Father's will, the Plan. Seeing Mary's despair, perhaps He felt distress at the suffering the Plan was causingâ€”He did not enjoy the fact that He was responsible for that suffering."}

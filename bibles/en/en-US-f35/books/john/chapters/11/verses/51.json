{"verse":"51","text":"(Now he did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die on behalf of the nation;The ‘nation’ in question would be the Jewish nation. I find it interesting that God would choose to speak through Caiaphas. He was not the real high priest (who was Annas) but reflected a Roman imposition whereby the Jews had to name a new one every year, and that year it was Caiaphas. Maybe from God's point of view Annas was worse."}

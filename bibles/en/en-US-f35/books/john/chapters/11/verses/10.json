{"verse":"10","text":"But if anyone walks in the night he does stumble, because the light is not in him.”“The light is not in him”—I take it that here in verse 10 Jesus refers to spiritual darkness and light, because no one has sunlight inside him. With God's light inside, Jesus was not going to stumble, regardless of the time of day."}

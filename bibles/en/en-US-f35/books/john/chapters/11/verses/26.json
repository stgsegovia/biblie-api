{"verse":"26","text":"and everyone who both lives and believes into me will never ever die.The verb ‘die’ in verse 25 refers to physical death, in verse 26 it refers to spiritual death, while the verb ‘live’ refers to spiritual life (although one might translate the Text as ‘will not die forever’, rather than “will never ever die”, indicating that physical death is temporary). Note that ‘lives’ and ‘believes into’ are in the present tense, and then note the word ‘both’. Once you have life in Christ, you need to keep on believing. Do you believe this?”"}

{"verse":"35","text":"Jesus wept.The verb rendered ‘wept’ is really ‘shed tears’, different from the verb in verse 33, which is often associated with mourning. Jesus was not mourning, knowing what He was about to do. So why did He weep? Perhaps He was empathizing with their grief. But I imagine that their hopeless perspective also troubled Him—their view of death was inadequate."}

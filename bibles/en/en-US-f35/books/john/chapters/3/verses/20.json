{"verse":"20","text":"For whoever practices evil hates the Light and does not come to the Light, so that his deeds may not be exposed.In John 7:7 Jesus said, “The world cannot hate you, but does hate me, because I testify about it that its works are malignant”, and in 8:12 He said, “I am the Light of the world”. Those who love darkness generally hate Jesus."}

{"verse":"6","text":"That which has been begotten by the flesh is flesh, and that which has been begotten by the Spirit is spirit.In 1:13 it is “begotten by God”, here “begotten by the Spirit”, in 3:3 and 7 “begotten from Above”—I take it that the expressions are synonymous. Without God's direct participation no one is saved."}

{"verse":"34","text":"For He whom God sent speaks God's words, because God does not give the Spirit by measure.The Text does not have “to Him”, but in the context that is presumably to be understood. To the Son the Father gave the Spirit in full measure, but not to us—at least not in the same sense."}

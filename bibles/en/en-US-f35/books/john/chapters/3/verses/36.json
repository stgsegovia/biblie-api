{"verse":"36","text":"The one believing into the Son has eternal life, but the one disobeyingThe Text has “disobeying”, not ‘disbelieving’. ‘Believing into’ has to do with commitment, with identification, with relationship. If you enter into a relationship with the Sovereign of the Universe, He is the Boss. Either you obey or bad things start to happen to you. the Son will not see the Life, but the wrath of God will remain upon him.”There are differing opinions about where the Baptizer's speech ends—the rest would then be a commentary by the author, John. The verbs in the present tense in verse 32 tip the decision in favor of the Baptizer—John would have had to use a past tense. I take it that the Baptizer's speech goes through verse 35, at least. Verse 36 could be an editorial comment by John, but I see no reason in the Text for taking the verse away from the Baptizer. Notice the verb ‘will remain’; the only way out is to obey the Son. (Perhaps 50% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘remains’, instead of “will remain”, which does not change the impact of the statement.)"}

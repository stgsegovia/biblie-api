{"verse":"5","text":"Jesus answered: “Most assuredly I say to you, unless someone is begotten by waterWhy ‘water’? Some have understood this to refer to water baptism, but it seems more likely to me that it refers to the Word (see Ephesians 5:26, John 15:3, John 17:17). As it says in Romans 10:17, “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.” and Spirit he is not able to enter the kingdom of God."}

{"verse":"4","text":"Jesus says to her: “What is that to you and me, woman?Jesus was not being disrespectful; this was a normal form of address. My time has not yet come.”I conclude from 1:43 that Jesus was at that wedding on purpose, and probably had an idea of what would happen. Perhaps He was testing His mother's faith, and maybe her determination. However, as He declares, He was not yet ready to really go public—He would do that in Jerusalem, as recorded in 2:13-25. He would start with a bang, right in the Temple!"}

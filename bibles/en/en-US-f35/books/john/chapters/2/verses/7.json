{"verse":"7","text":"Jesus says to them, “Fill the pots with water.” So they filled them to the brim.That was a lot of water! If it was toward the end of the festivity, there would presumably be a great deal of wine left over. Such excellent wine would bring a good price; perhaps Jesus chose this way to give the new couple a financial boost."}

{"verse":"15","text":"When He had made a scourge out of cords, He drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen;The impression I get is that it was mainly the animals that He drove, not the people; in the next verse He commands the dove-sellers to remove them, presumably still in the cages. and as for the moneychangers, He overturned the tables and scattered the coins."}

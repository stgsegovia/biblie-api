{"verse":"19","text":"Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple,The Lord gives an unexpected meaning to “this temple”, metaphoric, but this prophecy was literally fulfilled. and in three days I will raise it.”Since Jesus was referring to His own body, once He was dead how could He do this? His spirit did not die, and at the right moment returned to the body and raised it, uniting with it once again (and in so doing He glorified it)."}

{"verse":"23","text":"Now while He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name, observing the signs that He was doing.I take it that it was at this point that the Lord really began to heal on a large scale. He forced the religious leaders to take notice of Him in more ways than one. Nicodemus refers to these signs."}

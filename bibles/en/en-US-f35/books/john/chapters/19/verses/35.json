{"verse":"35","text":"And the one who saw has testified,John, the author of this Gospel, was right there (verses 25-26 above), so he could see very clearly what came out of Jesus' sideâ€”that the blood had separated was a clear sign of physical death. (I guess we don't need to know, really, just how the separation came about, whether by purely natural processes or with supernatural intervention; in any case, John is emphatic about what he saw.) and his testimony is true (yes, he knows he is telling the truth), so that you may believe."}

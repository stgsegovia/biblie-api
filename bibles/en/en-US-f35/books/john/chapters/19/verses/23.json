{"verse":"23","text":"Now when the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took His clothes and made four parts, a part for each soldier.This probably means that Jesus was left without any; one final bit of humiliation. They also took His tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top."}

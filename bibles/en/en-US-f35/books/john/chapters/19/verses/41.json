{"verse":"41","text":"Now at the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.Isaiah 53:9 affirms that the Messiah would have a rich man's burial, and He didâ€”a brand new tomb (rather large), and a hundred pounds of expensive spices. The body of an executed criminal would normally be treated ignominiously, and I imagine that was what the high priests intended, but the Father made sure that the Son received an honorable burial. Matthew 27:60 informs us that Joseph had himself prepared that tomb, and he did so at a spot near Golgotha. The next verse (here in John) indicates that this was done on purpose, for the reason mentioned. Joseph and Nicodemus clearly did what they did under divine guidance, and of course God knew that the tomb would need to be near Golgotha, etc."}

{"verse":"4","text":"Pilate then went out again and says to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I find no crime in him at all.”Pilate's reasoning is not obvious to me, unless the normal procedure would be to get on with the execution. But Pilate is not happy and is looking for a way out; he had received a message from his wife in the meantime (Matthew 27:19). Perhaps he hoped they would be satisfied when they saw how much He had already suffered."}

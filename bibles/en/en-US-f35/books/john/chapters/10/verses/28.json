{"verse":"28","text":"And I give them eternal life, and they will never ever be wasted; and no one will snatch them out of my hand.Being snatched is one thing; jumping out is another. You can't ‘snatch’ yourself, it must be done by an outside force, and no such force is greater than God. But, if you don't want to go to Heaven, you won't. Jesus puts it very plainly in John 15:6, “If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch…” ‘Abiding’ is up to us; we are not forced to do it. If we choose not to, we are out."}

{"verse":"9","text":"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved,Jesus is the doorway, the only means of access into eternal life, a truth He will emphasize again in John 14:6. and will go in and out and find pasture.What does a sheep want? Protection and pasture. These Jesus offers, but since people are more complex than sheep, He offers abundant life."}

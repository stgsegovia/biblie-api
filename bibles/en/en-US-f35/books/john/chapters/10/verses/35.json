{"verse":"35","text":"If He called them ‘gods’ to whom the Word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be brokenThe Lord inserts this as an aside, but it is an important statement in itself—Scripture cannot be broken. If we build our lives on God's Word we have a secure foundation, one that cannot be shaken. (Your faith in that Word may be shaken, but not the Word itself.)—"}

{"verse":"22","text":"Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem;Chapter 8 happened on Oct. 18, 29 (I think). Chapter 9 and 10:1-21 presumably happened shortly after. Here in 10:22 it is Dec. 17, 29â€”two months later. I suppose that Luke 10:1-14:24 occurred during those two months; which means that the seventy were sent out during the last six months of the Lord's earthly ministry. Their target was interior Judea, in contrast to the twelve, whose target was Galilee. and it was winter."}

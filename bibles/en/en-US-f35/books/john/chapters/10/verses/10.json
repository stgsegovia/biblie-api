{"verse":"10","text":"The thief comes only in order to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.The original thief is Satan. “The thief comes” VS “I have come”—since Jesus contrasts “the thief” with Himself, that thief is presumably Satan. Jesus calls him a murderer and a liar in John 8:44. A thief is usually a liar as well, and vice versa. I have come so that they may have life, and have it abundantly."}

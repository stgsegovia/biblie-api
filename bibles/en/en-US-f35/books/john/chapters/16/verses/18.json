{"verse":"18","text":"So they said: “What is this ‘little’ that He mentions? We do not know what He is talking about.”With hindsight it appears that the first ‘little’ referred to the less than 24 hours before His burial, when He would be hidden from view. The second ‘little’ would refer to the forty days between resurrection and ascension, during which they did indeed see Him."}

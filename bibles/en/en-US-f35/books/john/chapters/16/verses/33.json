{"verse":"33","text":"I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression;Just so. Any system dominated by Satan will be oppressive, for everybody, but his special malice will be directed at those who serve Christ. but take heart, I have conquered the world!”Yes, amen! I take it that the ‘world’ here refers to the world system controlled by Satan. Jesus did indeed conquer it. He lived within that system for 33 years without ever succumbing to it, without ever being tainted by it. Since He conquered the world, we can too! So let's take heart!"}

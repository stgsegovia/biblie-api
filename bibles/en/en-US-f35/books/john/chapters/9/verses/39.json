{"verse":"39","text":"And Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, so that those who do not see may see, and those who ‘see’ may become blind.”In verse 5 of this chapter Jesus declared Himself to be “the Light of the world”. Light enables people to see—“so that those who do not see may see”. But too much light blinds—“and those who ‘see’ may become blind”. The Pharisees had ‘spies’ dogging Jesus wherever He went, and they speak up in the next verse (40). Romans 2:17-20 explains their attitude: Look, you declare yourself a Jew, and rest on the Law, and boast in God, 18 and know the Will, and approve the superior things, being instructed out of the Law. 19 Further, you are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness, 20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth. [“The embodiment of knowledge and truth” is an excellent description of the Scriptures.] The light of the Law enabled them to see, up to a point, but the Light that Jesus offered blinded them, since they did not want to acknowledge it."}

{"verse":"32","text":"Since time began it was never heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.Jesus had already restored sight to many blind people, but evidently this was the first instance of giving sight to one born blind, congenitally blind. No one challenged the man's statement. The man's argument here is very strong; irrefutable, in fact."}

{"verse":"34","text":"They answered and said to him, “You were totally born in sins, and you are teaching us?” And they expelled him.The Pharisees here demonstrate their moral and intellectual bankruptcy. They couldn't answer the man, he had bested them fair and square, so they resort to the cowardly tactic of expelling him. (“Totally born in sins”—like the disciples, the Pharisees figured there was a lot of sin involved, for the man to be born blind.)"}

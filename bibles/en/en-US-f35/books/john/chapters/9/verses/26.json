{"verse":"26","text":"So they said to him again: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”The poor Jews are in a pickle. The fact of an extraordinary work of creation (giving sight where there never was any) won't go away, yet they refuse to acknowledge the obvious explanation. [Sort of like the ‘scientists’ of our day who refuse to acknowledge the Creator.]"}

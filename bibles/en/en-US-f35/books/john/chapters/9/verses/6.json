{"verse":"6","text":"Upon saying these things He spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud on the blind man's eyes.How unhygienic! The dirt in the street or road would be mixed with manure and all sorts of other contaminants, and human saliva is worse than a dog's. So why did Jesus do it? I don't know. Apparently it was part of His game plan to use a variety of procedures. There are cultures today where the shamans use saliva to heal, and to them this incident is especially significant."}

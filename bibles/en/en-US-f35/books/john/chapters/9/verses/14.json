{"verse":"14","text":"(Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.)7:37 says “the last day of the feast”, which was Tuesday, Oct. 17, 29 (I believe). Chapter 8 took place the next day, Wednesday. Here we are told that the healing of the blind man happened on a Saturday. Since we are still in Jerusalem (verse 7—Siloam is there), it may well have been the first Saturday after the events of chapter 8."}

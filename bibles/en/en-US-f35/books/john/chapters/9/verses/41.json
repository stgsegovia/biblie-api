{"verse":"41","text":"Jesus said to them: “If you were ‘blind’ you would not have sin. But now you say, ‘We see,’ so your sin remains.According to Romans 5:13, “sin is not imputed where there is no law”, because it is the Law that defines what sin is (Romans 3:20). So those who are without the light of the Law are ‘blind’ in that sense, and their sin is not imputed. In contrast, the Pharisees prided themselves on having the light of the Law, to the point of being guides to the blind, but since they themselves did not obey the Law, their sin remained."}

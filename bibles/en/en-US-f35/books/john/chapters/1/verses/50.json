{"verse":"50","text":"Jesus answered and said to him: “You believe because I said that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater than these.”The demonstrative pronoun is plural but ambiguous as to gender. Since I would expect the singular (presumably it was the single statement that caused Nathanael's belief) the plural leaves me in doubt. Is it greater things or people, or both?"}

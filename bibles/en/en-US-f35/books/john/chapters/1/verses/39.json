{"verse":"39","text":"He says to them, “Come and see.” So they went and saw where He was staying, and stayed with Him that day—it was about the tenth hour.This is significant. John uses Roman time, so this is 10 a.m. Which means that Jesus spent most of the day with just those two men. You had better believe they were talking the whole time. Jesus knew they would be two of His disciples and was already investing in them—to such good effect that the next day they bring in two more. The Text does not clarify whether or not they spent the night as well."}

{"verse":"42","text":"And he led him to Jesus. Looking at him Jesus said, “You are Simon, the son of Jonah;The Text says, “the son of Jonah”. Since Peter obviously had at least one brother, he was not an only son. Perhaps we should understand that Peter was the firstborn. Perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts (of objectively inferior quality) read “John” for “Jonah” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). you will be called Cephas” (which is translated ‘Stone’).Cephas is Aramaic for ‘stone’; πετρος is Greek for ‘stone’ (a small object, as opposed to a ‘rock’). The name ‘Peter’ is a transliteration into English of πετρος, but since ‘peter’ does not mean ‘stone’ in English, to put ‘Peter’ in verse 42 misses the point."}

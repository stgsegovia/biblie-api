{"verse":"13","text":"who were begotten, not by blood, nor by the desire of the flesh, nor by the will of a man,“The will of a man” seems obvious enough—many, perhaps most, people are born because a man decides he wants children. “The desire of the flesh”—many others are born because a man and a woman are carried away by physical attraction, whether or not they are planning to have a child. “By blood”—the best sense I can make out of this is to assume that it refers to levirate marriage; a man fertilizes his brother's childless widow to produce an heir for that brother, precisely because of the blood relationship between them. but by God.For a human being to be begotten physically a man must implant the seed of life, and to be begotten spiritually God must implant the seed of the Life."}

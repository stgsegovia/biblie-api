{"verse":"32","text":"And John testified saying: â€œI observed the Spirit coming down like a dove out of heaven, and He rested upon Him.John does not record the baptism of Jesus, as such, but we know from the other Gospels that this incident took place at that baptism. Nor does John record Jesus' confrontation with Satan in the wilderness. In general, John does not repeat information available in the other Gospels. (John wrote after the other Gospels had been in circulation for well over a decade.)"}

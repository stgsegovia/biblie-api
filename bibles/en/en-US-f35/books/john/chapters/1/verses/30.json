{"verse":"30","text":"This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is now ahead of me, because He existed before I did.’John was six months older than Jesus, so he is affirming that Jesus had a prior existence. Since a mere man cannot have a prior existence, John is affirming Jesus' divinity."}

{"verse":"9","text":"(For they did not yet know the Scripture, that He had to rise from among the dead.)But they should have; Jesus had told them repeatedly. But wait just a minute! Where in the OT is there such a Scripture? John wrote this Gospel over fifteen years after the other three had been ‘published’ and were in circulation, so his term ‘Scripture’ may be referring to them."}

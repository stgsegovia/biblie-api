{"verse":"27","text":"Then He says to Thomas: “Bring your finger here and perceive my hands; bring your hand and put it into my side;Since Jesus had not been there to hear Thomas, how did He know what he had said? We know the answer, but it delivered a knockout punch to Thomas. Evidently he did not try to touch Jesus, but without further ado said, “My Lord and my God!” do not be unbelieving but believing!”"}

{"verse":"21","text":"Then they wanted to receive Him into the boat,They were ready for some help. and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.They were still some four miles from Bethsaida, so here we have another remarkable miracle—Jesus transported the boat those four miles instantaneously. There have been repeated references to crossing the sea, so the reading of the so-called ‘critical text’ in Luke 9:10 that places the feeding of the 5,000 in the town of Bethsaida is patently ridiculous. What would motivate the editors to print such a ridiculous reading in their text?"}

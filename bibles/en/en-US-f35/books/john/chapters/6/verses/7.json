{"verse":"7","text":"Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of breadHow much bread can you buy with the wages for 200 days of manual labor? Probably an awful lot of it. But the crowd was so huge that Philip figured that even that much would not do it. [If a day's wage would buy 50 small loaves, for instance, that would make 10,000 loaves—more people than bread.] would not be enough for them, so that each of them could receive a little.”"}

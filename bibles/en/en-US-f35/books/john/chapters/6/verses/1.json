{"verse":"1","text":"After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, or Tiberias.From the parallel accounts it appears that He embarked at Capernaum. (Matthew informs us that He had just heard of the Baptizer's ignominious death and wanted to get awayâ€”perhaps to grieve and assimilate the news.) From John 6:23 we learn that the destination was near Tiberias. Capernaum and Tiberias are both on the western side of the Sea of Galilee, but there is a large bay between them; so they went over 6-8 miles of water."}

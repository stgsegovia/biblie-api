{"verse":"42","text":"And they were saying: “Isn't this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?I wonder why they refer to Joseph's parents. Of course they were assuming that Jesus was in fact Joseph's son. So how can he say, ‘I have come down out of Heaven’?”Notice that they understood clearly that Jesus was claiming that He had come down out of Heaven."}

{"verse":"24","text":"so when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boatsHow many people could those boats carry? Probably less than a hundred, all told, but these were special people who had stayed on the scene for a reason. and went to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.From Matthew and Mark I gather that from Bethsaida Jesus went directly to Genesaret; verse 59 below makes clear that the men found Him in Capernaum, which was close by. So why did Jesus send the disciples to Bethsaida? Perhaps it was to give an accounting to the owner of the place where the multitude was fedâ€”15,000 people can make quite a mess. (I suspect that Jesus had permission to use the place when He wanted to get away, but no one had foreseen such a crowd as that.)"}

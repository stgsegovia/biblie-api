{"verse":"5","text":"Then, raising His eyes and observing that a huge crowd was coming toward Him, Jesus says to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread so that these folks may eat?”According to the other three accounts, the disciples had already suggested to Jesus that He send the people away to the surrounding towns to buy food. But let's stop and think. How many bread stores would a village have, and how much bread would a store still have on hand at 5 p.m.? If they could have gone to every store within a radius of 30 miles, I doubt that they would have found even 10,000 loaves available. The Lord's question shows that their suggestion was really a cop-out."}

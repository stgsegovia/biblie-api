{"verse":"58","text":"This is the bread that came down out of Heaven. Whoever feeds on this bread of mine will live forever (in contrast to your fathers who ate the manna and died).”Many of those who died in the wilderness died in rebellion against God, so the “died” here may refer to spiritual death as well."}

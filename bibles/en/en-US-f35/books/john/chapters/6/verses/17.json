{"verse":"17","text":"and getting into the boat they started to go across the sea toward Capernaum.When they started out, the boat would be pointing toward Capernaum/Genesaret/Bethsaida; only as they went on would it become clear that their first destination was Bethsaida (Mark 6:45). Well it had been dark for a while and Jesus had not come to them.This statement puzzles me. The author of this Gospel was in that boat. Did they really expect Jesus to come to them over the water? How? Evidently they did not expect Him to come walking."}

{"verse":"45","text":"It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’See Isaiah 54:13. Therefore everyone who listens and learns from the Father comes to me.In verse 44 Jesus emphasizes God's sovereignty; here He emphasizes human responsibility. We can ‘listen and learn’, and then ‘come’. But in what sense is everyone “taught by God”? Everyone has the light of creation and is born with a conscience, at least. Perhaps there are other ways that God ‘teaches’."}

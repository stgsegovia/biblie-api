{"verse":"48","text":"“I am the bread of the Life.Since the Lord is obviously not claiming to be a loaf of literal bread, this is a figure of speech, a metaphor. Bread was their staff of life; they could not live without it. Jesus is our spiritual ‘staff of life’; we cannot live spiritually without Him."}

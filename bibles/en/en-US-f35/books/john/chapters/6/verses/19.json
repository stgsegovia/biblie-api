{"verse":"19","text":"Then, after they had rowed some three or four miles,The Text actually says ‘twenty-five or thirty stadia’. In Matthew 14:24 over 99% of the Greek manuscripts have them “in the middle of the sea”. If you draw a line from Tiberias to Bethsaida (see Mark 6:45) and put an X at four miles you will be in the middle of the widest part of the sea. Matthew further informs us that the wind was contrary and that Jesus came between 3 and 6 a.m. (the 4th watch). They had been on the water at least nine hours and most probably rowing most of that time (they were in a fishing boat, not a little rowboat). They were tired! From the parallel accounts it is clear that Jesus sent them on their way. He deliberately sent them into a difficult and trying situation. We need to understand that He may do the same with us. they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat; and they were afraid."}

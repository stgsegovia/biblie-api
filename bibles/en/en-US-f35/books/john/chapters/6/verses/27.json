{"verse":"27","text":"Do not work for the food that wastes away but for the food that endures into life eternal, which the Son of the Man will give you;Jesus will give the Life, but they have to work for the food that endures into that Life. So how do we “work for the food”? Most people have to work so as to have food to maintain their physical health and strength, and there are clear biblical strictures against laziness, so our Lord's statement presumably has to do with priorities. ‘Making a living’ should not be our top priority; like Jesus, our top priority should be to do the Father's will (Hebrews 10:7, John 4:34). What we build in ‘gold, silver, precious stones’ (1 Corinthians 3:12) will indeed “endure into” life eternal. because on Him God the Father has set His seal.”"}

{"verse":"19","text":"If you were of the world, the world would be fond of its own.The Greek verb is φιλεω, not αγαπαω. Actually, there is little, if any, αγαπη love in the world. So because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, that is why the world hates you.If the world doesn't hate you, perhaps you should stop and take stock. Why not? Are you just like them? Nothing about you challenges their lifestyle?"}

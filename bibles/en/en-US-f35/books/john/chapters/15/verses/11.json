{"verse":"11","text":"I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.I take it that ‘my joy’ is not exactly the same as ‘your joy’. I can often tell when God is happy with me, and when He is not, and it is directly tied to the level of my obedience. I take it that His joy remaining in us refers to His being happy with us; of course the only way our joy can be full is if He is indeed happy with us (because of our obedience)."}

{"verse":"24","text":"If I had not done among them the works that no one else has done, they would not be having sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.Presumably the Lord is not saying that they were sinless; I take it He is referring to a particular sinâ€”they rejected the full light that He brought, and are now overtly hating Him and the Father. Before Jesus ministered among them, they claimed that they loved God, and maybe actually thought that they did, but the Light exposed what they really were."}

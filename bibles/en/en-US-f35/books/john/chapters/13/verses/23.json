{"verse":"23","text":"Now one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining beside Jesus' bosom.They were reclining on their sides, propped up on their left elbows (unless someone was left handed). So John was next to Jesus, with his back to Jesus' bosom. In order to put his question, he leaned back until his shoulder touched Jesus' chest (he would have to rest his weight there), and in that way he was looking up at Jesus."}

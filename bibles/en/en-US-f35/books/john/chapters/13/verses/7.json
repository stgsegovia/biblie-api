{"verse":"7","text":"Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know [by experience] after this.”The Lord makes an important distinction here—He advises Peter that he doesn't understand what is going on, as Peter proves the next time he opens his mouth, but in the future his knowledge on this subject will have been gained by experience."}

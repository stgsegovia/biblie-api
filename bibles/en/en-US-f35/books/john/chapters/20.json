If someone had stolen the body, as Magdalene supposed, they would have taken the wrapped package (much easier to carry, not to mention 100 pounds of expensive spices) and there would have been no linen strips. If someone had unwrapped the body there would have been a mound of linen strips and spices piled up (how much cloth would it take to wrap up a hundred pounds of spices?). No, Jesus simply passed through the cloth, as He would later pass through the wall, leaving the package like a mummy or empty cocoon.

The Jerusalem at that time probably covered a relatively small area; it was probably no more than half a mile from the house to the tomb, if that, so she may have arrived as they were leaving; if not, they would pass her on the road.

I take it that Magdalene was an emotive person, capable of sudden ‘ups’ and ‘downs’. From the way the Lord pronounced her name she knew who it was; from deep sorrow she swings to a transport of joy and impulsively throws her arms around Him. Hey, she is not thinking of how this is going to read 2,000 years later; in fact, she is not thinking at all, just feeling. for I have not yet ascended to my Father;The causal connection here seems difficult to us—what did His not having ascended have to do with it? Various suggestions have been offered. My guess is as follows: Magdalene had not heard the teaching in the Upper Room, more precisely, John16:7. “I am telling you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, because if I do not go away the Enabler will not come to you, but if I go I will send Him to you.” She had just gotten her Master back and was not about to turn Him loose—she was feeling, not thinking. But Jesus had to ascend so He could send the Enabler, which would be better for everybody. She wants to hang on to Him, but He tells her to stop; the old relationships are gone, everything is now new. (Within a very few minutes He will allow the other women to hold His feet, so mere physical contact is not the problem; in fact, He will later invite the disciples to touch Him.) but go to my brothersHe does not just reprimand her, He gives her something to do. But just who are the “brothers”? Since the angel had told the other women to tell the disciples, I am inclined to imagine that the Lord sends her to His half brothers, although she started out with the disciples (next verse). and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father—my God and your God.’ ”"},{"book":"John","chapter":"20","verse":"18","text":"Mary Magdalene goes to the disciples, reporting that she had seen the Lord and He had said these things to her."},{"book":"John","chapter":"20","verse":"19","text":"Then at evening on that first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the middle, and He says to them, “Peace to you!”"},{"book":"John","chapter":"20","verse":"20","text":"And upon saying this He showed them His hands and His side.

Just as the Father sent me, I also send you.”This is tremendous! In my own experience (as a missionary, son of missionaries), I have seldom heard a missionary challenge based on John 20:21. The champion is Matthew 28:19-20, ‘the great commission’, followed by Mark 16:15 and perhaps Acts 1:8; but John 20:21? “Just as… so also”—Jesus is sending us just like the Father sent Him. So how did They do it? The Father determined and the Son obeyed: “Behold, I have come to do your will, O God” (Hebrews 10:7). And what was that will? To destroy Satan (Hebrews 2:14) and undo his works (1 John 3:8). Since Jesus did indeed defeat Satan (Colossians 2:15, Ephesians 1:20-21, etc.) what is left for us is the undoing of his works.

The primary reference is presumably to the sins of that person, but it is sometimes necessary to pronounce forgiveness for sins of past generations (see 2 Samuel 21:1-14). they are forgiven to them; to whomever you retain, they have been retained.”That is what the Text says, “have been”. The idea seems to be that sins are already retained (as soon as a sin is committed it is on the account); Jesus gives them the prerogative to change that situation, undoing the retaining, as it were. Presumably the forgiving and retaining have to do with the consequences of the sin in this life (not for salvation). I take it that the undoing of Satan's works (1 John 3:8) must reverse consequences (to the extent that this may be possible). Since Satan is involved in all sin, indirectly at least (or so I imagine), I conclude that verse 23 here falls within the competence of anyone who has the Holy Spirit."},{"book":"John","chapter":"20","verse":"24","text":"Now one of the twelve, Thomas (called Twin), was not with them when Jesus came."},{"book":"John","chapter":"20","verse":"25","text":"So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “If I do not see the nail prints in His hands and put my finger into the nail prints, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe!”Thomas is very emphatic.

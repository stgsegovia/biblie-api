{"verse":"8","text":"Upon experiencing this Simon Peter fell at Jesus' knees,Jesus was still sitting in the boat, only now surrounded by fish, probably up to His knees. saying, “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!”Do you find Peter's reaction to be curious? No doubt he felt pretty ‘small’ at that point."}

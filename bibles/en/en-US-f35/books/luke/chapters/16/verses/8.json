The sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of the Light.According to the value system of the world it is ‘smart’ to take advantage of other people, but those who follow the Light must be different. Of course the master's ‘commendation’ was sarcastic, since the dishonest manager still lost his job."}

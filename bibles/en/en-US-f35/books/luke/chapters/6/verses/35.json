{"verse":"35","text":"“So, love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High;I take the point to be that the behavior described indicates that the person already is a ‘son’ of the Most High. As it says in Ephesians 2:8-10, we do good works because we are saved, not in order to become so. because He is kind toward the ungrateful and wicked."}

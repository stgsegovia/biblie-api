{"verse":"41","text":"Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank that is in your own eye?Even a speck in the eye is very uncomfortable, making it hard to use that eye. An eye with a ‘plank’ would be useless, totally blind, so in effect Jesus is repeating the question, “Can a blind man guide?” On the other hand, a ‘plank’ is so large that one can grab it and remove it without sight. Unfortunately there are a lot of ‘blind’ teachers who don't think they are, and they do untold damage to their students."}

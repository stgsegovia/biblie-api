{"verse":"26","text":"Yes, whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of the Man will be ashamed of Him, whenever He comes in the gloryâ€”His, and the Father's, and of the holy angels.Revelation 21:8 says that a coward does not enter the Kingdom. In Matthew 10:33 Jesus said that He will deny before the Father whoever denies Him before men. To cave in under pressure is definitely not to be recommended."}

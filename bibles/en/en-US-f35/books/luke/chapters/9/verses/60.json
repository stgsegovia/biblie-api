{"verse":"60","text":"Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the Kingdom of God.”Dear me, how unfeeling! Those who are not committed to Christ and His Kingdom are as good as dead, and a true disciple of Jesus must not allow himself to be held back by such. Of course such an attitude will not be understood by the ‘dead’, but the disciple needs to side with the Kingdom. What if that father had lived for another ten years? If you put off doing God's will for things like that, you may wind up never doing it."}

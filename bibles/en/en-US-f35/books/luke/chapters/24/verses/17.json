{"verse":"17","text":"So He said to them, “What words are these that you are exchanging with one another as you walk, and are gloomy?”Instead of “…walk, and are gloomy?” a mere handful (0.5%) of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, have “…walk? And they stood gloomy.” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

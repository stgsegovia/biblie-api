{"verse":"16","text":"So the first one came and said, ‘Master, your mina earned ten minas!’How long would it take to multiply an investment ten times? Probably quite a while! That the man had to go to a distant country strikes me as unusual, and after he got there he may not have received the kingdom right away. The parable clearly relates to our Lord's absence and Return. We need to do the best we can with what He has given us."}

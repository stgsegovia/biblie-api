{"verse":"26","text":"(It had been revealed to him repeatedly by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death until he saw the Lord's Messiah.The Greek Text has ‘Christ’, but the Holy Spirit presumably used Hebrew to communicate with Simeon. The man evidently lived in communion with God, and thus the Holy Spirit could guide him at any time—here He sends him into the temple at just the right moment.)"}

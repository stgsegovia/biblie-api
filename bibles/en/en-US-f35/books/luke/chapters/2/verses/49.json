{"verse":"49","text":"So He said to them: “Why were you seeking me? Didn't you know that I must be about my Father's concerns?”At twelve Jesus knew precisely who He was—“my father” cannot refer to Joseph because Jesus was not discussing carpentry with the doctors of the Law—He was consciously about God's business. Notice that Jesus does not even come close to apologizing; in fact He rebukes them for worrying—after all, they also knew just who He was. (Jesus was no doubt unusually mature for His age, and may have just had His bar mitzvah.) The only time Jesus feared for His life was in Gethsemane—Matthew 26:38, Mark 14:34, Luke 22:44, Hebrews 5:7-8 (compare by contrast Luke 4:28-30, Mark 4:35-41, John 8:59, 10:39, 18:6)."}

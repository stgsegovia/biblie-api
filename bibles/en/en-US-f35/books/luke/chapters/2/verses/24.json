{"verse":"24","text":"and to offer a sacrifice according to what was specified in the Lord's Law, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons”.See Leviticus 12:8. The prescribed sacrifice was a lamb; only if the couple was too poor to bring a lamb could they substitute the birds (since they could be caught in the wild, the poorest of the poor could meet this requirement). Evidently Joseph and Mary could not afford a lamb, which indicates that they had not yet received the gifts from the magi."}

{"verse":"35","text":"so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed (furthermore, a sword will pass through your own soul also).”Watching her Son suffer, Mary would also suffer. Jesus obliged the people, especially the leaders, to take sides, and so the reasonings of their hearts were exposed."}

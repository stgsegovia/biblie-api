{"verse":"34","text":"Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing”;The eclectic text currently in vogue (following less than 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality) places within double brackets the first half of verse 34: “Then Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing’ ”. In this way they deny that Luke wrote it, surely a perverse proceeding. while they were dividing up His clothes by casting a lot."}

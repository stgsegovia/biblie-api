{"verse":"46","text":"Then, after giving a loud shout, Jesus said, “Father, it is into your hands that I will commit my spirit.” And having said this, He breathed out His spirit.Both Matthew and John state overtly that Jesus dismissed His spirit. In John 10:17-18 He had declared that no one could kill Him, He would lay down His own life. The cross did not kill Jesus, as the centurion recognized (see the next note)."}

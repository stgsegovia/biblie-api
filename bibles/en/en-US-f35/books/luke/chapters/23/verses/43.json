{"verse":"43","text":"Jesus said to him, “I tell you assuredly, today you will be with me in Paradise.”For Jesus to say ‘today’, He knew the man would die before sundown, so He knew the man's legs would be broken—otherwise he would most likely have lasted well into the night, which would have been ‘tomorrow’. ‘Paradise’ here refers to that half of Hades (Sheol in the OT) reserved for the righteous dead. Hades is the ‘halfway house’ where departed spirits await the final judgment. In Luke 16:22 it is called “Abraham's bosom”."}

{"verse":"53","text":"Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock, where no one had ever been laid.Obviously the tomb had been prepared beforehand, and was a fulfillment of Isaiah 53:9, “He made His grave…with the rich at His deaths [plural]”. Nicodemus had already placed a hundred pounds of spices in the tomb, before helping Joseph remove and carry the body (John 19:39)."}

{"verse":"39","text":"Then one of the hanged criminals started berating Him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”According to Matthew 27:44 and Mark 15:32, both of them started out by reviling Him, but later one of them repented—they were on the cross for about three hours before the supernatural darkness, so there was time to observe Jesus, which caused one of them to change his mind."}

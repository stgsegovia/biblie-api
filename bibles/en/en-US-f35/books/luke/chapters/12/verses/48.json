{"verse":"48","text":"But he who did not know, yet did things worthy of blows, will be beaten with few.Note that even sins done in ignorance are punished. However, the more one knows, the more severe the punishment. Everyone to whom much has been given, from him much will be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him much more will be asked."}

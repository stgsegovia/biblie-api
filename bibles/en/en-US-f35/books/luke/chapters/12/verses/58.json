{"verse":"58","text":"“When you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort along the way to settle with him,The point seems to be that the ‘adversary’ has exhausted all other means of getting his money back; which would indicate a serious flaw in the character of the ‘debtor’. lest he drag you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the bailiff, and the bailiff throw you into prison."}

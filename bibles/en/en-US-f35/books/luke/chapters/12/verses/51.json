{"verse":"51","text":"Do you imagine that I came to provide peace on the earth? Not at all, I tell you, but rather division.So why is He called the ‘Prince of Peace’? On several occasions, after healing someone, He said, “Go into peace” (not ‘in peace’). Jesus offers peace with God, but you must believe into Him in order to receive it."}

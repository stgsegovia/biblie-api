{"verse":"21","text":"nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ because indeed the Kingdom of God is within you.”They were probably thinking of the Messianic Kingdom, that will indeed have a concrete starting point, but the Lord does not give them that information. He does go on to say to the disciples that the onset will be sudden. In the meantime, the King's true subjects have the Kingdom in their hearts, which presumably did not include those Pharisees, so ‘within you’ would be a generic statement."}

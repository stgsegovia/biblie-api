{"verse":"28","text":"But He said, “More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and obey it!”Since the Text declares the Virgin Mary to be blessed, Jesus was not denying that blessedness. To hear and obey God's Word is even more blessed. The basic meaning of the verb I translated ‘obey’ is to guard or protect. I wonder if there is a special blessing for those who defend God's Word."}

{"verse":"24","text":"“Whenever an unclean spirit goes out from a man,The Lord does not say why the spirit left. If it had been expelled by someone who knew how to send it to the Abyss, it could not come back. it passes through waterless places seeking rest; and not finding any it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’"}

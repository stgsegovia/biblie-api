{"verse":"19","text":"Further, if I am casting out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out?I find this question to be intriguing. Jesus is evidently saying that their sons do indeed cast out demons, so why don't they also censure their sons? Or is the implication that Satan's servants can appear to be casting out demons? Therefore they will be your judges."}

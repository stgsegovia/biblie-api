{"verse":"13","text":"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”Does this apply to true believers who have the indwelling Holy Spirit? Did this ‘rule’ change at Pentecost? If not, how does it apply to us today? Since ‘ask’ is in the present tense, perhaps it was occasion by occasion."}

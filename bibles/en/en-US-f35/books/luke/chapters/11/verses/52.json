{"verse":"52","text":"Woe to you lawyers! You have taken away the key of knowledge;Hosea 4:6 reads, “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge … Because you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.” Notice the awful price paid by the children! Are today's ‘doctors of the law’ not guilty of the same thing? you yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering!”They were really perverse. If they did not want to go in themselves, that was their choice; but to try to stop others was really perverse!"}

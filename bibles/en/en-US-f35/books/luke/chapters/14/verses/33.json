{"verse":"33","text":"“So likewise, any of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be my disciple.Notice that three times Sovereign Jesus says, “cannot be my disciple”, and the ‘cannot’ is a strong negative. Jesus demands first place in our lives and hearts—above family, material things, our very selves."}

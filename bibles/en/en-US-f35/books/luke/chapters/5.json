However, Jesus had said to let down ‘nets’ (pl), but Peter let down only one. 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, read ‘nets’, to be followed by most modern versions.

The modern versions that follow the 1% render ‘present with Him to heal’, or some such thing, which the text does not say."},{"book":"Luke","chapter":"5","verse":"18","text":"And then, some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a cot, and tried to take him in and place him before Him."},{"book":"Luke","chapter":"5","verse":"19","text":"When they could not find how to do it, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him with the cot through the tiling into the center, in front of Jesus."},{"book":"Luke","chapter":"5","verse":"20","text":"Seeing their faith He said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you!”Those men were really determined, but they wanted healing, not forgiveness of sins; however, Jesus had His own agenda."},{"book":"Luke","chapter":"5","verse":"21","text":"So the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying: “Who is this who speaks blasphemies?

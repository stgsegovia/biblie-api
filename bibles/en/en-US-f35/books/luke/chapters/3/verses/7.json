{"verse":"7","text":"Then he said to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him: “You sons of poisonous snakes!We don't know the precise type of snake, except that it was presumably poisonous. The Text has ‘offsprings’, plural, which doesn't make very good English, so I put ‘sons’. From Matthew 3:7 we may conclude that he was mainly referring to Pharisees and Sadducees (who had come to evaluate what was happening, but did not themselves submit to the baptism; they would not want to admit that they had sin to confess). Who tipped you off to flee from the coming wrath?"}

{"verse":"9","text":"But even now the axe is being laid to the root of the trees;The Messiah was about to be introduced and to begin His public ministry; among other things He would condemn the Pharisees and other ‘snakes’—‘thrown into the fire’ refers to their eternal destiny. so then, every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”"}

{"verse":"3","text":"So he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins;There are those who squirm at the plain meaning of the Textâ€”John was offering forgiveness of sins. Well, throughout the Old Testament, if you brought an animal offering you were confessing to being a sinner, and expecting to be forgiven. As forerunner to the Lamb of God, who would provide the ultimate payment for sin, John represented a transition, from the old to the new."}

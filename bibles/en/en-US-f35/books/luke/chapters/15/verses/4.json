{"verse":"4","text":"â€œWhat man among you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not abandon the ninety-nine in the wildNotice that the 99 are left in the wild, not a sheepfold. So what happens if a wolf comes upon the 99 while the shepherd is off looking for the stray? I confess that I never liked this parable, for that reason. and go after the lost one until he finds it?"}

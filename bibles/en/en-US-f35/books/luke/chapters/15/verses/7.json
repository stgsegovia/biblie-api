{"verse":"7","text":"I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous ones who have no need of repentance.If God prefers sinners, what is the point of being righteous? I suppose the point to be that no one is so righteous that they need no repentance. Since we are all sinners, we all need to repentâ€”and when we do so, God is happy."}

{"verse":"10","text":"So He said: “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest only in parables, so that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’See Isaiah 6:9. The Lord plainly states that He used parables so that people would not understand. It follows that doctrine should never be based on a parable—however, if the parable is explained, the explanation may be used."}

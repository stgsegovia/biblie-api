{"verse":"33","text":"Then the demons exited the man and entered the pigs—and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned!I very much doubt that the demons engineered that reaction; it would have been counterproductive, leaving them without a ‘home’. Animals often show more good sense than do humans, and they may have preferred death to demons. (And I suppose it is possible that Jesus Himself commanded the action, since pork was proscribed for God's people.)"}

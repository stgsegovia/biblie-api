{"verse":"30","text":"Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”I assume that Jesus knew the demon's name without asking, so why did He ask? I would say that He wanted it to be part of the Record, to teach us that demon infestation can and does occur. And he said, “Legion” (because many demons had gone into him)."}

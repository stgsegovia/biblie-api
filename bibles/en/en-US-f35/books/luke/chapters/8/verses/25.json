{"verse":"25","text":"So He said to them, “Where is your faith?”In other words, He is telling them that they could, and should, have done something about it themselves. Had we been there, would we have done any better? But being terrified they marveled, saying to each other: “Who can this be?This puzzles me; after all the miracles they had seen, they still wonder who Jesus is! Well, maybe controlling nature is in a ‘higher league’ than controlling sickness and demons. Still, what were the options: human, angel (good or bad), or God. Because He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”"}

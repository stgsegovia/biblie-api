{"verse":"18","text":"So be careful how you hear:Spiritual growth is like going up an incline on a bicycle with no brakes; if you stop pedaling, you start going backwards. Either we grow, or we start losing what we have. There is no standing still. So be careful how you hear! Because whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.‚Äù"}

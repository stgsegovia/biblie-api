{"verse":"38","text":"and as she stood behind Him at His feet weeping,He was reclining on a ‘couch’ with His head in toward the table, so His feet were ‘available’. she began to wet His feet with her tears and kept wiping them with the hair of her head; and she kept kissing His feetTo do all of this she would have to be kneeling. She started by standing, and probably waited a minute to see if anyone would object. and anointing them with the perfume.This is a moving picture. She was ashamed and distressed, because of what she was, but she desperately wanted to change, and she saw in Jesus the way out."}

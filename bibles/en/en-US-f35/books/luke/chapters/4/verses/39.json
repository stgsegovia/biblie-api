{"verse":"39","text":"So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them.Normally a high fever leaves one weak, so the Lord reversed the consequences of the fever as well. I take it that Matthew 8:14-15 records a different occasion. Just because God heals you once does not mean you will not get sick again."}

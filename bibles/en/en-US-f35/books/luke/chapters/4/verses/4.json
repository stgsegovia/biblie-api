{"verse":"4","text":"Jesus answered him saying, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’ ”See Deuteronomy 8:3. Less than half a percent of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “but by every word of God” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). If we are to live by ‘every’ word, then every word must be kept available."}

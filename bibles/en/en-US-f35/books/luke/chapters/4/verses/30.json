{"verse":"30","text":"But He, passing through the middle of them, went on His way.“Passing through the middle of them, He went on His way”—now how did that happen? To throw Him down, someone would have to be holding Him, probably a man on each arm, and they had gotten Him there by force, and He was surrounded.

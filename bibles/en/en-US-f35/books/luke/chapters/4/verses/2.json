{"verse":"2","text":"where He was tested for forty days by the devil.We are not told just how Satan did this. He ate nothing at all during those days, so after they were completed He was hungry.This episode was ordained by the Holy Spirit. Jesus had to confront Satan when He was physically the weakest He would ever be (40 days without food!). When Satan failed to defeat this weakened Jesus, he was probably filled with despairâ€”he now knew that he could never defeat Him (but he would still try to kill Him). Hebrews 2:18 and 4:15-16 give at least part of the reason why Jesus had to undergo this experience."}

{"verse":"7","text":"So you, if you would worship before me, all will be yours.”This was a master stroke. Jehovah the Son entered this world as the second/last Adam precisely to recover what the first Adam had lost, and Satan was evidently well aware of what was going on. So he offers it to Jesus on a ‘silver platter’, with just one small condition… Note that Jesus does not deny Satan's right to make the offer."}

{"verse":"19","text":"to proclaim the Lord's favorable year.”Jesus interrupted the reading of Isaiah 61:2 at a coma—‘the great parenthesis’. The part that He read pertained to His first coming, but “the day of vengeance of our God” pertains to His second coming—the ‘parenthesis’ is closing in on 2,000 years."}

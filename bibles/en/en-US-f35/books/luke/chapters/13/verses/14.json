{"verse":"14","text":"But the ruler of the synagogue reacted with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, and he said to the crowd, “There are six days in which one should work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath.”Of course the woman had not come to be healed; she came to worship God. It was the Lord's initiative, so the ruler's complaint was really directed at Him."}

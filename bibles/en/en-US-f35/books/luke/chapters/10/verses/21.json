{"verse":"21","text":"In that same hour Jesus exulted in His spiritMost versions capitalize ‘Spirit’ and just over 3% of the Greek manuscripts state overtly, ‘the Holy Spirit’, but I take it that Jesus exulted in His own spirit. and said: “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to ‘infants’. Yes, Father, because it pleased you to do so.”"}

{"verse":"22","text":"And turning to the disciples He said:Some 10% of the Greek manuscripts omit “And turning to the disciples He said” (as in most versions), which confuses the quote. Jesus changes from addressing His Father to addressing the disciples. The clause is repeated at the beginning of verse 23, but ‘privately’ is added. “All things have been entrusted to me by my Father; also, no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and to whomever the Son may choose to reveal Him.”"}

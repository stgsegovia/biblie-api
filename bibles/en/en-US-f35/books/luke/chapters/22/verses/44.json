{"verse":"44","text":"And being in anguish He prayed with total concentration;I believe that Hebrews 5:7 refers to this moment. To transpire blood is normally fatal, so Jesus came close to dying there in the garden. But He had to get to the cross, so the Father sent an angel to strengthen Him. The sleeping disciples did not observe this, so Luke received this information ‘from Above’ (Luke 1:3). then His sweat became like clots of blood, falling to the ground.The eclectic Greek text currently in vogue places verses 43-44 within double brackets (based on 1.3% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality), thereby denying that Luke wrote them. These verses contain important information that should not be questioned on such a feeble basis."}

{"verse":"36","text":"So He said to them: â€œBut now, he who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword must sell his garment and buy one.If you are obviously armed, this tends to slow down those who would otherwise attack you or take advantage of you. It is better yet to have spiritual power."}

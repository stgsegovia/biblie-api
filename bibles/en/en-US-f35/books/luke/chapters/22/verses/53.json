{"verse":"53","text":"When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour; even the authority of the darkness!”This was Satan's hour, being part of the Father's Plan; ‘the darkness’ refers to Satan's kingdom; ‘your hour’ means that they were part of that kingdom."}

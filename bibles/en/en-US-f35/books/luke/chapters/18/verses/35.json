{"verse":"35","text":"Then it happened, as He approached Jericho,Luke has Jesus approaching Jericho, while Matthew and Mark have Him leaving it. In Jesus' day there were two Jerichos, the old one that had been rebuilt, and a new one, about a kilometer away. What better place to beg than between the two towns? Jesus had left the old Jericho and was going toward the new one. For further discussion, please see the Appendix: “Entering or leaving Jericho?”. that a certain blind man was sitting alongside the road begging."}

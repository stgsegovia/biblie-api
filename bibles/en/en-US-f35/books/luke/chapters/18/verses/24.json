{"verse":"24","text":"When Jesus saw that he became sad, He said: â€œHow difficult it is for those who have riches to enter the Kingdom of God!The parallel passage in Mark (10:24) clarifies that it is those who trust in riches. How many rich people do you know who do not trust in their riches? (That clarification is omitted by less than half a percent of the extant Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, as in the eclectic text currently in vogue.)"}

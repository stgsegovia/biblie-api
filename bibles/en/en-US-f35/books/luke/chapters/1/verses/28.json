{"verse":"28","text":"So upon entering where she was the angel said, “Rejoice, recipient of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!”To be the mother of the Messiah was a blessing granted to only one woman in the whole history of this world (see Genesis 3:15). Less than 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit ‘blessed are you among women’ (to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

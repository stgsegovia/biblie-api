{"verse":"19","text":"So in answer the angel said to him: â€œI am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God;Gabriel is no ordinary angel, possibly one of the cherubim; he is probably not far below Michael in rank. He imposes his authority on the priest. I was sent to speak to you and bring you this good news."}

{"verse":"34","text":"So Mary said to the angel, “How shall this be, since I do not know a man?”Zacharias expressed doubt, but Mary simply requests some necessary information. She has understood that God wants her to be the Messiah's mother—she was doubtless highly intelligent and perceptive. (In the Bible the verb ‘to know’ is used to refer to sexual intercourse.)."}

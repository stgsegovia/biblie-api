{"verse":"31","text":"Now then, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS.Although the angel presumably addressed Mary in Hebrew, when it came to pronouncing the name, he may well have used the Greek name as we know it. The precise sequence of sounds can be written and pronounced in Hebrew."}

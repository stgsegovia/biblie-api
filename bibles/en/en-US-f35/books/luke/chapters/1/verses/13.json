{"verse":"13","text":"But the angel said to him: â€œDo not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer was heard,Given his expression of doubt this evidently was not a recent prayer. Zacharias had given up hope (since having a child was now a physical impossibility), and may well have been unhappy with God for not having answered. He was not even impressed with the tremendous things the angel said, but continued to doubt. and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John."}

{"verse":"21","text":"who will transform the body of our humiliationAlthough, as the Psalmist says, we are “fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14), it is also the case that our physical bodies limit us, and not infrequently that limitation reaches the point of being humiliating. Personally, I am ready and waiting for my glorified body, but in the meantime, I am very happy to be able to contribute to Christ's Kingdom down here. so that it will be conformed to the body of His glory, according to the working by which He is indeed able to subject all things to Himself."}

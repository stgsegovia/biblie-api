{"verse":"11","text":"and so, somehow,“And so, somehow”—this really does not sound like ‘once saved, always saved’. The writings of the Apostle Paul contain a variety of clear declarations to the effect that God is Sovereign; they equally contain a variety of clear declarations to the effect that we are responsible. In spite of having given up everything for Christ, in spite of being an Apostle, Paul is not resting on his laurels, is not taking anything for granted. He clearly recognizes his own responsibility to “press on”. that I may arrive into the resurrection from among the dead"}

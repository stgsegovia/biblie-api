Paul evidently considered that the three types of people constituted a threat, but how can we identify and distinguish them? “The mutilation” is explained, by contrast, in the next verse—it refers to those who insisted on physical circumcision, but without a change of heart. This was a heresy within the broader Christian community that had originated in Jerusalem. As for the “bad workers”, the adjective used is not ‘malignant’, that refers to aggressive evil. A bad worker produces work that is inferior, careless, or even sabotage, and in consequence can be damaging and dangerous. I suppose Paul is referring to people within the Christian community who are not really committed to Christ and His Kingdom. As for the ‘dogs’, I am obliged to confess that I do not know who Paul was referring to, though the use of the definite article indicates a specific group that the Philippians would recognize. In Deuteronomy 23:18 ‘dog’ apparently refers to a male prostitute, a catamite, and is declared to be an abomination. In OT times dogs were scavengers and therefore unclean, and were generally looked down upon. In Jesus' day Jews referred to Gentiles as ‘dogs’, but since many Gentiles are in the Church (and the church in Philippi doubtless had a large Gentile contingent) that is certainly not the intended meaning here. The ‘dogs’ in Matthew 7:6 react in an aggressively hostile manner against what is holy; I take it that they are people who are overtly serving evil, and being malignant they are aggressive. I would say that Paul certainly had a copy of Matthew's Gospel, and may well be following the Lord's use. This text may be referring to that sort of person, and in that event they would be outside the congregation."},{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"3","verse":"3","text":"For it is we who are the circumcision, the ones who worship by God's Spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in flesh"},{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"3","verse":"4","text":"(though I myself actually have basis for such confidence)."},{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"3","verse":"5","text":"circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; with respect to the Law, a Pharisee;"},{"book":"Philippians","chapter":"3","verse":"6","text":"with respect to zeal, persecuting the Church; with respect to the righteousness that is in the law, blameless.Since Paul did not choose to be born to Hebrew parents, Benjaminites, nor to be circumcised the eighth day, these were advantages of birth.

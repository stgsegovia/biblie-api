{"verse":"29","text":"For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe into Him,The Text never has “believe ‘in’ Jesus”; we must believe into Him. Being on the outside we must change location. This involves commitment and a change of worldview or value system. but also to suffer for His sake,If you were taught to expect a ‘bed of roses’, you had a bad teacher."}

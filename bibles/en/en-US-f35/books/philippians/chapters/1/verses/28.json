{"verse":"28","text":"and not being intimidated in any way by your opponents: to them this is an indicator of ruin,How shall we understand this? What is the effect of our boldness in the face of oppositionâ€”do the opponents consider that we are sealing our own fate, or do they suspect that they may be on the wrong side? Perhaps both. but to you of deliverance,Our confidence in God assures us of deliverance, one way or another: by life or by death. and that from God."}

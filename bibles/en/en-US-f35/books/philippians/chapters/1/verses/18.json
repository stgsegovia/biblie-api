{"verse":"18","text":"No problem: in every way, be it in pretense or in truth,The Bible is clear to the effect that the means, not just the end, must be appropriate to God's character, so this statement seems a bit strange. Within the community of faith deviations can be treated quite severely, but perhaps for what we might term ‘pre-evangelism’, getting people who have never heard of Him before to start thinking about Christ, there may be some leeway. Further, Matthew 20:1-16 makes clear that God is prepared to use a variety of types of worker. Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice—yes, and will rejoice."}

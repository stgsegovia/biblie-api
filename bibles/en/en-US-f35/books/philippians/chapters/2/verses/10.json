{"verse":"10","text":"so that at the name of JesusNote that it is at the name of Jesus, not Christ or even Jehovah, that every knee will bow. ‘Jesus’ is His human name—recall that in Revelation the slain Lamb (5:6,12; 7:14; 12:11) receives glory and praise along with the Father. You cannot kill God, so the Lamb is Jesus. Recall further that in John 5:22 Jesus affirmed that the Father had “committed all judgment” to Him, which means that it will be Jesus sitting on the “great white throne” (Revelation 20:11), not to mention a certain “winepress” (Revelation 19:15). Although at the moment I see no way of ‘closing the question’ (as we say here in Brazil), I verily suspect that the correct transliteration of ‘Jesus’ into Hebrew will prove to be יֵסוּס and not יֵשׁוּעַ. every knee will bow—of those in heaven,This presumably includes the angels, whether or not they have literal ‘knees’. those on earthThose actually alive on the earth when this decree is imposed; I suppose it will be during the millennial Messianic Kingdom. and those under the earthSince Hades is inside the earth (Matthew 12:40, Ephesians 4:9, 1 Samuel 28:13), this will presumably include the wicked dead, as well as the demons in the Abyss (at least). Just suppose that God wanted to confine evil to this planet; the logical place for a ‘prison’ would be beneath its crust.—"}

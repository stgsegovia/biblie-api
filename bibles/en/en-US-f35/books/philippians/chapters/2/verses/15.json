{"verse":"15","text":"so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and depraved generation,Can there be any doubt that our generation is crooked and depraved? And it is not getting any better. among whom you shine as light bearers in the world,As we both live out and actively promote biblical values, the “Word of Life”, we will stand out like a bright torch at night. The darker it is, the farther any light can be seen."}

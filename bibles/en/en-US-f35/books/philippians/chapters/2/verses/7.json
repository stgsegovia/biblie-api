{"verse":"7","text":"but divested Himself, taking a slave's form, coming to be in the likeness of men.Note that to be a human being is to be a slave. We are born slaves, live slaves and die slaves. We are born slaves to self, sin and death (with Satan behind the scenes); Christ offers us the option of being slaves to God, good and life. You can't stop being a slave, but you can choose your owner."}

{"verse":"41","text":"The Son of the Man will send out His angels,The angels are going to be busy. and they will collect out of His kingdom everything that is offensive, and those who perpetrate lawlessness;I take it that the “kingdom” here is physical (not merely ‘spiritual’) and includes the whole planet, because it contains “offensive” things and “lawless” people."}

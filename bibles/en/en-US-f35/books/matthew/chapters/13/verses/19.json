{"verse":"19","text":"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the malignant one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart—this is the seed sown alongside the road.In sowing, the seed is scattered on top of the soil, not planted, and is therefore vulnerable—maybe that is why the great commission is to disciple. Observe that Jesus is teaching that the devil can invade a person's mind."}

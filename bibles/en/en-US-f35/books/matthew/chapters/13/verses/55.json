{"verse":"55","text":"Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joses and Simon and Jude?Here we have the names of Jesus' four half-brothers, and the plural ‘sisters’ means there were at least two of them (the use of ‘all’ probably indicates more than two). Joseph and Mary had a normal family."}

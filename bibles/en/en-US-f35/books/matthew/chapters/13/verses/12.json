{"verse":"12","text":"For whoever has, to him more will be given and he will have abundance;But he will have to give an accounting for it all. but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.Spiritual growth is like going up an incline on a bicycle without brakes; if you stop pedaling you go backwards. We must keep learning and growing; if we stop, we start losing."}

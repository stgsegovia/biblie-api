{"verse":"52","text":"So He said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his reservoir things new and old.”A ‘scribe’ was instructed in the Law and the prevailing interpretations of it (the ‘old’), but if he had also been discipled into the Kingdom, his thinking would be reoriented about many things (the ‘new’)."}

{"verse":"10","text":"Now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy!It reappeared after two years. They had undertaken an expensive and dangerous journey in the dark, as it were. Now God confirms that they are on the right track. They are beside themselves with joy! It guided them to the very house."}

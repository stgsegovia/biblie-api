{"verse":"18","text":"And I further say to you that you are a stone, but on this bedrock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not withstand her.There is a play on words here, πετρος VS πετρα—the bedrock was obviously not Peter. The bedrock presumably has to do with the fact that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of the Living God. ‘Gates’ do not attack, but are the last line of defense—it is the Church that is attacking Hades. Hades is not hell. Hell is the Lake of fire, the second death; Hades is the halfway ‘house’ where departed spirits await the judgment."}

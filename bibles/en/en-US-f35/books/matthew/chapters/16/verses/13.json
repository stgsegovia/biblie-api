{"verse":"13","text":"When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi He questioned His disciples saying, “Who do people say that I, the Son of the Man, am?”Instead of “I, the Son of the Man, am”, perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, have ‘the Son of the Man is’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). The change is significant."}

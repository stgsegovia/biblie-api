{"verse":"20","text":"Then He ordered His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Messiah.As is clear from Luke 9:20-22, verses 21-23 here form part of the same conversation. At this point Jesus changes the game plan—He declares that He is going to die and orders the disciples to stop presenting Him as the Messiah. Some 65% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘Jesus, the Messiah’ (as in AV and NKJV); I follow the best line of transmission."}

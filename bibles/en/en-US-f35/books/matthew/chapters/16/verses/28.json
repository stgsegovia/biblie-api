{"verse":"28","text":"Assuredly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of the Man coming in His kingdom.”Presumably this was fulfilled at the transfiguration—a manifestation, in miniature, of the Kingdom (Jesus the King, Moses and Elijah representing glorified saints [who will participate in the administration] and the three disciples representing the normal inhabitants of the earth at that time)."}

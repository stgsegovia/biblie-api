{"verse":"19","text":"As you go,The familiar ‘therefore’ is found in perhaps 5% of the Greek manuscripts. make disciples in all ethnic nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;Our Lord defines the Trinity here. According to Greek grammar the use of ‘and’ plus the definite article with items in a series makes clear that the items are distinct entities. So “the Father” is different from “the Son” is different from “the Holy Spirit”. So we have three persons. But He also said, “in the name”, singular, not ‘names’. So we have only one name. God is one ‘name’ or essence subsisting in three persons."}

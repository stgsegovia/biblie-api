{"verse":"10","text":"Then Jesus says to them: “Do not be afraid! Go report to my brothersThe angel said “disciples”, but Jesus said “brothers”. It may be that He was referring precisely to His half-brothers James, Jude, etc. They would not have been in the upper room with the Eleven, and so did not see Him at that time. that they must go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”"}

{"verse":"9","text":"and don't even think to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father,’They had notions of spiritual privilege based on birth, but as someone has said, God has no grandchildren. Later on Jesus will make clear that they did in fact reject John's message—they were not baptized. for I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."}

{"verse":"15","text":"But in answer Jesus said to him, “Permit it now, because thus it is appropriate to us to fulfill all righteousness.”Our Lord's statement here seems difficult to us. Since Mark 1:4 and Luke 3:3 state that it was “a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins” but Jesus had no sins to repent of, in what sense was He “fulfilling all righteousness”? Perhaps as Messiah and Great High Priest He needed to identify Himself with those of His people who were truly repentant. Then he permitted Him."}

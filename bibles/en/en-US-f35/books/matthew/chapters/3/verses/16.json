{"verse":"16","text":"And having been baptized Jesus came up directly from the water, when wow, the heavens were opened to Him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and alighting upon Him.The episode is presented from John's perspective, while in Mark 1:11 and Luke 3:22 it is presented from Jesus' perspective. Just as at Pentecost the Holy Spirit translated into the ears of the foreigners, I take it that here Jesus heard one thing and John another."}

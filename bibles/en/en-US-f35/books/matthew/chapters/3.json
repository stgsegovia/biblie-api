Later on Jesus will make clear that they did in fact reject John's message—they were not baptized. for I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"10","text":"Indeed, already the ax is being laid to the root of the trees.The Messiah was already present, and He would condemn the Pharisees and Sadducees. So every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"11","text":"“I baptize you with water unto repentance, but the One coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit.There is no article with ‘Holy Spirit’, so I take the phrase as a proper name. The ‘and fire’ we are used to is read by only 20% of the Greek manuscripts. The 80% includes the best line of transmission. However, Luke 3:16 has the ‘and fire’."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"12","text":"His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”Can you have wheat without chaff? Isn't the chaff part of the wheat plant? What might the implications of this analogy be for the Church? What percentage of the plant is edible wheat? Wherever Christianity is the state or majority religion, or part of the prevailing culture, a large majority of the ‘Christians’ will be chaff. Where Christians are persecuted a high percentage will be wheat. Since Judaism was part of the prevailing culture, presumably most of John's hearers were chaff. The ‘unquenchable’ fire is presumably a reference to the Lake."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"13","text":"Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"14","text":"But John tried to dissuade Him saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?”John knew that Jesus was the Messiah."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"15","text":"But in answer Jesus said to him, “Permit it now, because thus it is appropriate to us to fulfill all righteousness.”Our Lord's statement here seems difficult to us. Since Mark 1:4 and Luke 3:3 state that it was “a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins” but Jesus had no sins to repent of, in what sense was He “fulfilling all righteousness”? Perhaps as Messiah and Great High Priest He needed to identify Himself with those of His people who were truly repentant. Then he permitted Him."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"16","text":"And having been baptized Jesus came up directly from the water, when wow, the heavens were opened to Him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and alighting upon Him.The episode is presented from John's perspective, while in Mark 1:11 and Luke 3:22 it is presented from Jesus' perspective. Just as at Pentecost the Holy Spirit translated into the ears of the foreigners, I take it that here Jesus heard one thing and John another."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"3","verse":"17","text":"And wow, a Voice from the heavens saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I am always well pleased!”The Trinity is clearly manifested: voice = Father, Jesus = Son, dove = Holy Spirit.

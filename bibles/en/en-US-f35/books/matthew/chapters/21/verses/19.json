{"verse":"19","text":"And seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He went up to it and found nothing on it, just leaves.As Mark points out (Mark 11:13), it was not fig season, but a tree with leaves might have some dried figs. Since dried figs are very good eating, any visible figs would have been eaten long since (the tree was near the road). And He says to it, “May you never again produce fruit!” And forthwith the fig tree started to wither.The Text has ‘the sap was cut off’; the result would not be visible immediately."}

{"verse":"45","text":"As the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables they knew that He was speaking about them.They understood, so they were warned; but they did not pay attention to the warning. They went to hell with their eyes open. They would rather go to hell than acknowledge Jesus as Messiah. Today it is the same wayâ€”many would rather go to hell than acknowledge Jesus as Creator and Savior."}

{"verse":"43","text":"Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.That is what the Text says, ‘a nation’, which makes me wonder which ‘nation’ that might be. Since at any given time a nation is made up of the people alive at the moment, an Israel in the distant future would be a different ‘nation’. However, in 1 Peter 2:9 the Church is called “a holy nation”, so perhaps the reference is to the Church."}

{"verse":"34","text":"And then, the whole town went out to meet with Jesus; and upon seeing Him they begged Him to depart from their borders.Apparently Jesus never went back there; they did not want Him and that was that (I doubt that the inhabitants were Jews). The dead pigs represented a big economic loss; the pigs were more important to them than the two menâ€”what Jesus represented threatened their way of life."}

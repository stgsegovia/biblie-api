{"verse":"29","text":"And then—they cried out saying: “What do you have to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”The demons knew who Jesus really was, and also about their own destiny. The parallel accounts in Mark 5 and Luke 8 give added detail—their name was ‘Legion’, and there were about 2,000 pigs. In Luke 8:31 they kept imploring Him not to send them to the Abyss—they were really worried; they knew something we do not."}

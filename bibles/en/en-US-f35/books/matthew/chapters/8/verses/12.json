{"verse":"12","text":"but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness farthest away. There, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”“Sons of the kingdom”—those who knew the truth and rejected it will have the severest judgment, “farthest away”. (Dante's view of hell is perhaps not entirely mistaken.)"}

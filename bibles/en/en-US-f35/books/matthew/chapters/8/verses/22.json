{"verse":"22","text":"But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”When it comes to discipleship, Jesus is very demanding—ordinary physical comfort and normal human relationships must be held in abeyance. Since a physically dead person can't do anything, it is the spiritually dead who are to do the burying. To wait for a father to die before doing God's will could mean never doing it."}

He had seen them, and had himself refused to hire them until the end. As his desperation level increased, he became less and less choosy about the quality of the workers [I take it that for some reason the grapes had to be collected that day; any that were left until later would be lost].

What about our own notions of ‘fairness’? People who trust in Christ at the end of a misspent life get to go to Heaven, just like those who have served God all their lives. Of course there is the matter of rewards, but they scarcely compare with the fact of spending eternity in Heaven, rather than Hell."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"20","verse":"9","text":"The eleventh hour ones came and each received a denarius."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"20","verse":"10","text":"So when the first ones came they supposed that they would receive more; yet each of them also received a denarius."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"20","verse":"11","text":"When they received it they began grumbling against the landowner"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"20","verse":"12","text":"saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who bore the burden and the heat of the day!’"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"20","verse":"13","text":"But in answer he said to one of them: ‘Friend, I am not wronging you.

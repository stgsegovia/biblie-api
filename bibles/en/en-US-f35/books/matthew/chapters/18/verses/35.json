{"verse":"35","text":"“My heavenly Father will handle you just like that, if each of you does not forgive his brother his trespasses, from the heart.”This is a very strong statement! Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “his trespasses” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). Note the ‘fellow servant’ and ‘his brother’—presumably declared enemies of Sovereign Jesus are not in view."}

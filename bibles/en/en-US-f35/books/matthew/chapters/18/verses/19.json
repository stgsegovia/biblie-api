{"verse":"19","text":"Assuredly again, I say to you that if two of you should agree on earth about any subject whatever that they may ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.If you are like I am, you have probably tried this, and it didn't work! Why not? I suppose because verses 19 and 20 must be taken together. The ‘because’ that begins verse 20 gives the clue—if Jesus is part of the group that is asking, then His will limits the asking."}

{"verse":"39","text":"The one ‘finding’ his life will lose it, and the one ‘losing’ his life for my sake will find it.I take it that the reference is to the potential that your life represents, potential in the interests of God's Kingdom. To the extent that your life revolves around God's will and Kingdom you will both find and save it—of course from the world's perspective you will be throwing it away."}

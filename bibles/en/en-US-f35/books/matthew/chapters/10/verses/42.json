{"verse":"42","text":"And whoever should give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these little ones, in the name of a disciple, assuredly I say to you, he will certainly not lose his reward.”Presumably the rewards mentioned here are received in this life, since the good deeds mentioned could be performed by an unbeliever. I suggest that God blesses anyone who takes sides with what is right, good, decent, honorable, just—but if that person does not belong to Christ the blessing is limited to this life."}

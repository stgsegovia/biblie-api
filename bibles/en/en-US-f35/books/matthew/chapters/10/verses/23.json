{"verse":"23","text":"But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to another.This sounds like the life of a refugee. For assuredly I say to you, you will certainly not go through all the cities of Israel before the Son of the Man comes.Beginning with verse 18, but especially in verses 21-23, Jesus is probably referring to the end times, more than to their immediate future."}

{"verse":"10","text":"nor a knapsack for the road, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs;They were to travel ‘light’—a spare staff would just be extra weight (they went everywhere on foot); with no knapsack a spare tunic and pair of sandals would just get in the way. However, this was a temporary instruction for a specific occasion. Later, in the upper room, He revoked this instruction (Luke 22:35-36). Perhaps 5% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘neither a staff’ (singular), that sets up a contradiction with Mark 6:8, to be duly followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc. because the worker is worthy of his food."}

{"verse":"41","text":"The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward,I assume that the point here is identification: you are identifying with the prophet whose name you invoke; and if that prophet is in prison, you are taking a risk. and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward."}

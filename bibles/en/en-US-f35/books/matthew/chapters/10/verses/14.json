{"verse":"14","text":"And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out from that house or city shake off the dust from your feet.This is an instruction, an order. Paul did it at least onceâ€”Acts 13:51 (as have I). Jesus Himself declares this judgment upon Capernaum (Matthew 11:23-24), thereby setting the example."}

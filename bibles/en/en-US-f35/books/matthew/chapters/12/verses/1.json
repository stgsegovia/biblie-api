{"verse":"1","text":"At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath.The Text actually has ‘the Sabbaths’; the parallel passage in Luke 6:1 has ‘a second-first Sabbath’. This was evidently a special day, but we have lost the relevant cultural information. But His disciples became hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."}

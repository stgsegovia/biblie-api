{"verse":"32","text":"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of the Man, it will be forgiven him;Statements like this need to be interpreted against the background of all other Scriptures that bear on the subject. Forgiveness depends on confession (1 John 1:9). but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in the present age nor in the next.Mark 3:30 makes clear that “the blasphemy against the Spirit” is to ascribe His working to Satan."}

{"verse":"34","text":"Brood of vipers!At no time did the Lord make any effort to conciliate the Pharisees. They are ‘serpents’ because their father is a serpent (Revelation 12:10). How can you, being malignant, speak good things?Jesus appears to be saying that a malignant person is incapable of speaking good. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."}

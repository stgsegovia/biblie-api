{"verse":"17","text":"From then on Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near.”Right! The King was walking among them. “Kingdom of the heavens” and “kingdom of God” are synonyms, as can be seen by comparing parallel passages in Mark and Luke. Jesus continues with John's message, since the herald is now out of action."}

{"verse":"2","text":"And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.This episode was ordained by the Holy Spirit. Jesus had to confront Satan when He was physically the weakest He would ever be (40 days without food!). When Satan failed to defeat this weakened Jesus he was probably filled with despairâ€”he now knew that he could never defeat Him. (But he would still try to kill Him.)"}

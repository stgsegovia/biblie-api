{"verse":"22","text":"“The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.Of course we have two eyes, but the Text has “eye” in the singular. I take it that the reference is to the way we interpret what we see (which is our real ‘eye’)—two people, one pure and one vile, observing the same scene will give very different interpretations to it."}

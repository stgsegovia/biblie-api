{"verse":"23","text":"But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness.“Evil” here has the idea of malignant—aggressively evil. Someone with a malignant mind will give an evil interpretation to everything he sees, and in consequence his being will be filled with unrelenting darkness. Compare Titus 1:15. So if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"}

{"verse":"53","text":"and coming forth out of the graves after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and were made visible to many.Wow! How would you like a departed saint to knock at your door?! It would be tremendous confirmatory evidence for Christ's resurrection. The Text does not say what happened to these resurrected saints, but to be sent back into the ground would be a real drag. It is more likely that they went with the risen Christ to heaven.)"}

{"verse":"30","text":"Spitting on Him they took the reed and hit Him repeatedly on the head.Here they get nasty. The thorns were probably poisonous and the blows drove the points into His scalp down to the bone. His face began to swell from the poison; the blood oozing from the wounds was mixed with the spit. We assume from Isaiah 50:6 that the soldiers also yanked out parts of His beard, which would have torn away the skin as well. The total effect must have been horrible, leaving Jesus unrecognizableâ€”Isaiah 52:14 was literally fulfilled."}

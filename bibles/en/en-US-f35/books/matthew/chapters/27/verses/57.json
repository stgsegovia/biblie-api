{"verse":"57","text":"Now at evening there appeared a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.He “appeared”—he had been waiting in the wings. Just as with the owner of the donkey, and the owner of the upper room, who were doubtless advised in advance that their services would be needed, Joseph was prepared. He didn't just “happen” to have a tomb he didn't know what to do with, complete with a large stone just right for sealing. According to Isaiah 53:9 He was to have a rich man's grave, not whatever the common criminals got (the Father did not allow the Son's body to suffer that humiliation)."}

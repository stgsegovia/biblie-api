{"verse":"34","text":"they gave Him sour wine mixed with gall to drink;This was a small humanitarian gesture—gall is a crude anesthetic, and would deaden the pain. But Jesus refused it, so He remained fully alert on the cross and felt it all. For a discussion of the seeming discrepancy with Mark, please see the Appendix: ‘Gall’, or ‘myrrh’? but having tasted it He would not drink."}

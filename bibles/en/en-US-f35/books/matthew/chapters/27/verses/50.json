{"verse":"50","text":"Then Jesus called out again with a great shout and dismissed His spirit.Oh praise God! Jesus dismissed His spirit (see also John 19:30)—it was not the cross that killed Him (for details see the note at 27:54 below). As He said in John 10:18, “no one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself”. I take it that John 19:30 gives the content of the shout—Τετελεσται! = “Paid in full!” It was a shout of victory."}

{"verse":"24","text":"When Pilate saw that nothing was being gained but rather a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man.Perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “righteous” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). Notice that Pilate declares Jesus to be righteous. It's your problem!”"}

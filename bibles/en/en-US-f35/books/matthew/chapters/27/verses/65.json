{"verse":"65","text":"So Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go make it as secure as you can!”Was Pilate happy? No he was not! And maybe, just maybe, he was not as stupid as some might like to think. From Mark 15:44-45 we know that he debriefed the centurion, who had to explain why Jesus died sooner than expected! “Make it as sure as you can.” Right. For a detailed analysis concerning Pilate, please see the Appendix: Poor Pilate—wrong place, wrong time."}

{"verse":"21","text":"However, this class does not go out except by prayer and fasting.”Less than 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit this whole verse (as in NIV, [NASB], LB, [TEV], etc.). I take it that this was true up until the Lord's victory on the cross and the resurrection. Now we are in Christ at the Father's right hand, far above all principality and power, etc., which includes Satan and all classes below him in rank—Ephesians 1:19-21, 2:6. (There is nothing wrong with Christ's victory and authority, but our spiritual condition does not always permit us to make full use of that victory.)"}

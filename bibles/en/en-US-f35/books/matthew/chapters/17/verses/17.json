{"verse":"17","text":"Then in answer Jesus said: “O faithless and perverse generation,Why “perverse”? To reject the truth and the evidence is to be perverse. This word was presumably directed to the disciples, who should have known better by now. So how about us—are we living on the basis of the truth and the evidence? Really? how long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.”"}

{"verse":"21","text":"For she kept saying to herself, “If only I may touch His garment I will be healed.”It is clear from Mark 5:27-30 that the woman was healed before Jesus turned around. At other times contact with the shadow or a handkerchief brought healing. There is a principle at work here that we no longer understand, but satanists use all the time."}

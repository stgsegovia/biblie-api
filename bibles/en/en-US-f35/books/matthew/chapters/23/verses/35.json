{"verse":"35","text":"—so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah,The only ‘Zechariah son of Berechiah’ recorded in the OT was the author of the book of prophecy that bears his name. The temple was rebuilt during his time, so it would be possible for him to have been killed there, but his death is not recorded. The Lord may have known something we do not, or He may have been referring to someone else. whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.A terrible statement! But Jesus is addressing persons who will condemn the Messiah to death with total premeditated malice."}

{"verse":"14","text":"Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!! Because you bar the entrance to the kingdom of the heavens in the face of the people; for you neither go in yourselves nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in.Those guys were really perverse! If you don't want to go in yourself, that's your problem; but to try to keep others from going in is satanic, really and truly satanic."}

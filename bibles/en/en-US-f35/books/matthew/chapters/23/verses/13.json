{"verse":"13","text":"â€œWoe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you devour the houses of the widows,How did that work? I suppose that if the widow was in debt, they would just foreclose and put her out on the street. while making long prayers as a pretense. Therefore you will receive a greater condemnation.They are already condemned, but are making it worse. Perhaps 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit this verse (as in NIV, [NASB], LB, [TEV], etc.). A very small minority, perhaps another 1%, reverse the order of verses 13 and 14 (as in KJV and NKJV)."}

{"verse":"21","text":"And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who used to dwell in it.Some 10% of the Greek manuscripts have “dwell” in the present tense (as in most versions), rather than the past. I take it that Jesus was telling them that God had left their temple (see verse 38). Thus verse 22 is in contrast with verse 21, with reference to God's presence."}

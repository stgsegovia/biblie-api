{"verse":"10","text":"Neither be called leaders/guides; because your Leader is one, the Christ.This may be why we have no record in Scripture of a Christian calling someone his disciple; even in 1 Corinthians 3:4 Paul evidently avoids using the term. I take it that our Lord is forbidding any effort by one Christian to control the spiritual life of another. He had already told the Samaritan woman that the Father must be worshiped “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24). Therefore, that worship may not be forced or imposed, or controlled by someone else."}

{"verse":"9","text":"And do not call anyone on earth your ‘father’; because your Father is one, He who is in the heavens.Since the second person here is plural, the Lord is evidently referring to calling someone your spiritual father; He is not saying not to acknowledge your physical father. “Your (pl.) Father is one”—obviously they did not all have the same physical father."}

{"verse":"18","text":"and anyone in the field should not go back to get his cloak.Wait a minute! If you are on the housetop or in the field, how can you “see” the ‘abomination’ so you know it's time to run? Well, how about wrist TVs, hand held computers, cell phones with Internet access, etc.? So how did Jesus know about these gadgets 2,000 years ago? If you are still around when that happens, and if you do not want the ‘mark’, you had better disappear in a hurry."}

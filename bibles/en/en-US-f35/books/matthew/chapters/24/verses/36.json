{"verse":"36","text":"“But no one knows concerning that day and hour,It is typical of Hebrew prose (Jesus is a Jew) to retell a sequence of events from different perspectives. He is still answering “What is the sign?” but here He starts over and comments upon something that will happen before the ‘abomination’ (see the second footnote after this one). not even the angels of the heavens, except my Father alone.While walking this earth as Jesus, the Son was not omniscient."}

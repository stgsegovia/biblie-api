{"verse":"28","text":"for wherever the carcass may be there will be a gathering of vultures.The point of verses 26-28 seems to be that the Lord's return will be very obvious, like the lightning or the circle of buzzards above a carcass—so if someone says He has returned secretly, don't believe it (see verse 30). The word “then” in verse 23 makes clear that what is being described here is the Lord's return to the earth after the Great Tribulation, to set up the Millennial Kingdom."}

Here, it is presumably a reference to premarital sex, where a groom discovers that his bride is no longer a virgin (like the situation that Joseph faced in Matthew 1:18-19). Perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit the last clause of verse 9 (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"19","verse":"10","text":"His disciples say to Him, “If that's the situation of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry!”Why the strong reaction from the disciples?

No one is good except One, God.Jesus is not denying that He is good. He is challenging the man's opinion about Himself. The man was not recognizing Jesus to be God—if he had, Jesus would not have objected. Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “Good” before “teacher” in verse 16 and have Jesus saying, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is One who is good” here in verse 17 (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). The minority reading makes Matthew contradict Mark 10:18 and Luke 18:9; it probably originated in Egypt, that was dominated by Gnosticism.

However, since in verse 26 Jesus says it is “impossible” we may stay with the literal meaning. Jesus had already said that one cannot serve God and money, so someone who “trusts in riches” (Mark 10:24, as in 99.5% of the Greek manuscripts) simply cannot be saved (unless he abandons that trust)."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"19","verse":"25","text":"Upon hearing it His disciples were really flabbergasted saying, “Who then can be saved?”"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"19","verse":"26","text":"So looking at them Jesus said, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"19","verse":"27","text":"Then Peter answered and said to Him: “See, we have left all and followed you.

Actually, the ‘hundredfold’ should presumably not be taken in a strictly literal sense. I take it that the Lord is saying that we will be abundantly recompensed, if not down here, certainly in heaven. In my own experience, in the absence of my real mother, whenever I needed one God provided one. If you only have one brother, that is all you can leave, obviously, so the plural nouns are also contingent on the facts in the case. ‘Eternal’ life is a quality of life, and it begins down here. or children or fields for my name's sake will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit life eternal."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"19","verse":"30","text":"But many ‘first’ will be last, and ‘last’ first."}]}

{"verse":"2","text":"Because with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.The use of the future tense probably points toward God. If we call for judgment, not mercy, on others, by so much we are calling for judgment, not mercy, on ourselves."}

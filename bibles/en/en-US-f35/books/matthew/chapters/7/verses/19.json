{"verse":"19","text":"So every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.The Lord is very clear about the eternal destiny of people who do not produce good fruit. Remember Ephesians 2:8-10â€”we are not saved by good works, but we are indeed saved for good works; if we do not produce, we are not saved."}

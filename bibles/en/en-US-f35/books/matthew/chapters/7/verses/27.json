{"verse":"27","text":"and the rain fell, and the rivers rose, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall!”Here again, we have to do the words. Note that both houses had to face the same circumstances, but the verbs are different. Everyone faces adversity in this life—your foundation determines the outcome. Why do the adverse circumstances ‘attack’ one house, but only ‘beat on’ the other? The verb ‘attack’ implies an intelligence ordering the circumstances."}

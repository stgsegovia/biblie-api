It seems to indicate a perfect human prototype, like Adam was before the fall—the human side of the God-man."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"8","verse":"21","text":"Then a different one of the disciples said to Him, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"8","verse":"22","text":"But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”When it comes to discipleship, Jesus is very demanding—ordinary physical comfort and normal human relationships must be held in abeyance.

Gadara was the Roman capital of the province of Perara, located some six miles from the Sea of Galilee. For the swineherds to run six miles to the city to report the incident and then walk back with the people would take quite a while. It seems more likely that there was a village named ‘Gergesa’ nearby, whose people came and asked Jesus to leave.

The parallel accounts in Mark 5 and Luke 8 give added detail—their name was ‘Legion’, and there were about 2,000 pigs.

And then—the whole herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water!I really doubt that the demons did it—why would they want to destroy their new ‘house’? Perhaps the pigs preferred death to demons (animals often show more common sense than people do).

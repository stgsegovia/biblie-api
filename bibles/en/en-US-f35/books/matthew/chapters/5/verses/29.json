{"verse":"29","text":"So if your right eye is causing you to fall, tear it out and throw it away; because it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be thrown into hell.This is literal, but mostly theoretical, since by the time people realize they are in trouble it is usually too late; they are already trapped. Perhaps this is why Hebrews 3:13 tells us to “exhort one another daily… lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin”. Sometimes others see that we are in trouble before we do."}

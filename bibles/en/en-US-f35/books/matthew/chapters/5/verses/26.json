{"verse":"26","text":"Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.Verses 25-26 refer to financial debt, through property damage, a loan, etc. There is no doubt about the fact of the debt, and the time limit has expired; and you are on the way to courtâ€”at that point the only way out is to humble yourself and throw yourself on the mercy of the creditor."}

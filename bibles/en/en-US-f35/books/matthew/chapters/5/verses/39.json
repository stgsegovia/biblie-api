{"verse":"39","text":"But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.Do not use physical violence to respond to physical violence—but we can use our spiritual authority. Animals must resort to force, but Adam was given dominion over the animals, which presumably was not exercised with physical force—we should not lower ourselves to the animal level; but Satan tries to trick us into doing so. If someone lashes out in anger, turning the other cheek should shame him."}

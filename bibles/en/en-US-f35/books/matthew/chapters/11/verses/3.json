{"verse":"3","text":"to say to Him, “Are you the Coming One, or do we look for another?”John was in prison, which was contrary to his expectations; like all the others he expected Jesus to set up the Kingdom right then. In answer the Lord says, in effect, that the Kingdom is not based on our expectations."}

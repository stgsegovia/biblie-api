{"verse":"6","text":"And, blessed be whoever is not offended at Me!”Verse 6 was directed specifically at John. When Jesus went to John to be baptized, John knew perfectly well that he was looking at the Messiah, but now, because of his circumstances, he is in doubt. In effect, Jesus is saying, “Whatever you do, do not rebel!” And He is still saying so to us: when your circumstances are painful and unexplained, do not rebel!"}

{"verse":"30","text":"for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”To be without a yoke is not an option in this world. It is either Jesus' yoke or Satan's—if you refuse Jesus' yoke you remain under Satan's yoke, which is always heavy. Being born with an inclination to sin, we are soon under Satan's yoke—Jesus offers us a way out."}

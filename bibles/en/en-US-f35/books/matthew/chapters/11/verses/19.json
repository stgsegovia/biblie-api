{"verse":"19","text":"the Son of the Man came eating and drinking and they say, ‘Just look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Indeed, wisdom is vindicated by her children.”Instead of “her children”, just 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality (objectively so), have “her works” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

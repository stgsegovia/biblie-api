{"verse":"22","text":"But in answer Jesus said: “You (pl.) do not know what you are asking.Jesus sees that the sons had put their mother up to it and answers them, not her. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am being baptized with?”Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “or be baptized with the baptism that I am being baptized with” and also the corresponding clause in verse 23 (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). They say to Him, “We are able.”"}

{"verse":"6","text":"Now about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and he says to them, ‘Why have you stood here idle all day?’How did he know they had been there all day? He had seen them, and had himself refused to hire them until the end. As his desperation level increased, he became less and less choosy about the quality of the workers [I take it that for some reason the grapes had to be collected that day; any that were left until later would be lost]. As the Church is in its eleventh hour, or later, it seems to me that we see God doing just like the landowner—He is using some rather ‘unusual’ workers."}

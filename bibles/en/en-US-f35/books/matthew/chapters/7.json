If we call for judgment, not mercy, on others, by so much we are calling for judgment, not mercy, on ourselves."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"3","text":"So why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye but do not consider the plank in your own eye?"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"4","text":"Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ when hey, there is a plank in yours?"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"5","text":"Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.Can you have a ‘plank’ in your eye without knowing it? (The tiniest bit of grit is an unbearable irritant.) When a person does not want to admit or correct his own failures, it is standard defensive procedure to call attention to the failures of others."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"6","text":"“A Do not give what is holy to the dogs, B nor cast your pearls before the pigs; B lest they trample them with their feet, and A turning around they tear you to pieces.This verse may be a chiasmus, AB,BA. But just who are ‘the dogs’ and ‘the pigs’? A pig will sniff the pearl and perhaps think it a stone—it not being edible the pig will ignore it and it will get trampled into the mud. So a ‘pig’ is someone who is incapable of recognizing or appreciating the ‘pearl’—the reaction will be one of total indifference. So do not waste your time. In contrast a ‘dog’ reacts in an aggressively hostile manner against what is ‘holy’. So a ‘dog’ is presumably someone who is committed to evil and will therefore attack what is holy. In general our media today are controlled by ‘dogs’. So do not innocently offer what is holy to a ‘dog’—you will get chewed up! We need to try to convert the ‘dogs’, but you need to understand what you are about. Anyone who has sold out to Satan will almost certainly have a resident demon, and we have the authority to bind such."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"7","text":"“Keep asking, and it will be given to you; keep seeking, and you will find; keep knocking, and it will be opened to you."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"8","text":"For each one asking, receives; and the one seeking, finds; and to the one knocking it will be opened."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"9","text":"Or which man is among you who, if his son asks for bread will give him a stone?"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"10","text":"Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake?"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"11","text":"If you then, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!I take it that we are authorized to ask!"},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"12","text":"So then, whatever you want people to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.This is the so-called ‘golden rule’—if everyone did this the world would be a better place."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"13","text":"“Go in through the narrow gate; because wide is the gate and broad is the way which leads away into perdition, and those who are going in through it are many."},{"book":"Matthew","chapter":"7","verse":"14","text":"How narrow is the gate and confined the way which leads away into life, and those who are finding it are few!Observe that the Lord Jesus Christ affirms that “few” find the way of life.

{"verse":"13","text":"Upon hearing it, Jesus departed from there by boat to a deserted place privately.From Mark we learn that Jesus and the disciples were under heavy pressure from the crowdsâ€”no time even to eat. So when He hears of John's death, and under such ignominious circumstances, Jesus wants to get away so He can grieve and assimilate the news. But when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the towns."}

{"verse":"14","text":"So when Jesus disembarked He saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them and healed their sick.In Mark it is even clearer that the people ran along the shore and got to the destination first, before the boat (please see the note at Mark 6:34). Naturally the faster runners were there first, but others kept arriving so that in the end there were thousands of people. In the town there was not space for everybody to get to Jesus, but out in the openâ€”so when the news got around people came from all over."}

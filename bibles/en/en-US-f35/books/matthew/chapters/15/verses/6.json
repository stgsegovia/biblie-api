{"verse":"6","text":"then he must not honor his father or mother.’Perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “or mother” (as in NIV, LB, TEV, etc.). NASB informs us that “many” manuscripts omit “or his mother”—by ‘many’ they mean three, against some 1700! That is a dishonest use of language. Thus you have nullified the commandment of God through your tradition."}

{"verse":"30","text":"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.Jesus does not say that angels do not have sex/gender. Evidently no baby angels (good or fallen) are born, but if angels are of only one gender they cannot reproduce in kind. Whenever an angel takes on human form in the Bible, it is always the form of a man. Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit “of God” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

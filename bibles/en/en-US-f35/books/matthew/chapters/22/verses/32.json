{"verse":"32","text":"‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?See Exodus 3:6,15,16—Jesus attributes this text to God! God is not God of dead people but of living.”Jesus argues on the basis of the present tense of the verb—if Abraham was simply eradicated it would have to be “was”. Jesus implies that they should have figured it out for themselves."}

{"verse":"13","text":"Then the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot, take him away and throw him out into the darkness farthest away.’Someone tried to ‘crash the party’ and had even taken a place at a table, but it did not work. I suppose there may be those who think they can crash “the marriage supper of the Lamb”, but if you are not dressed in the righteousness of the Bridegroom you will not make it. There there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."}

{"verse":"4","text":"but the prudent ones took oil in their vessels along with their lamps.From verse 8 it is clear that they all had oil in the lamp, but even with the wick down low their lamps were lit (they wouldn't wait in total darkness) and were burning oil (4-5 hours). So the delay of the bridegroom meant that the oil in the lamps was used upâ€”the wise ones had extra oil."}

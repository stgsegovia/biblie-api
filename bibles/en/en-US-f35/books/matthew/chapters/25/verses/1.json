{"verse":"1","text":"“Then“Then”—this temporal adverb links the parable to the prior context, which is dealing with the Rapture (I think). Since the foolish ones are virgins, not prostitutes, and since they also had some oil (does the oil represent the Holy Spirit?), this parable may point to a partial rapture; only those who are ready are taken. the kingdom of the heavens will be like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom."}

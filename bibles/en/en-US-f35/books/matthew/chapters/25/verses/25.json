{"verse":"25","text":"And being afraid I went off and hid your talent in the ground; here, take what is yours.’Evidently the third man did not identify with his lord's interests. He served out of fear or necessity, but his heart wasn't in it. He has a negative opinion of his lord and is unrepentant: “here, take what is yours”. He winds up in hell. Are there not many ‘Christians’ today who have a low opinion of God? Who feel that He is hard, unfair, unjust—and who ‘serve’ out of fear or a sense of obligation? If you believe into Jesus you identify with Him."}

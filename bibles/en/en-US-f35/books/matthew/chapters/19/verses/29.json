{"verse":"29","text":"And, everyone who left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wifePerhaps 1.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit “or wife” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)—the idea of having 100 wives was no doubt objectionable. Actually, the ‘hundredfold’ should presumably not be taken in a strictly literal sense. I take it that the Lord is saying that we will be abundantly recompensed, if not down here, certainly in heaven. In my own experience, in the absence of my real mother, whenever I needed one God provided one. If you only have one brother, that is all you can leave, obviously, so the plural nouns are also contingent on the facts in the case. ‘Eternal’ life is a quality of life, and it begins down here. or children or fields for my name's sake will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit life eternal."}

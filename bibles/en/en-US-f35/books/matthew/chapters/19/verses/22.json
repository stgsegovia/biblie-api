{"verse":"22","text":"So upon hearing that word the young man went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.Jesus emphasized the commandment about loving one's neighbor because that was precisely the one that the young man was not keeping. He went away sorrowful because Jesus made him see that he was not keeping it, and worse yet, was not prepared to keep it."}

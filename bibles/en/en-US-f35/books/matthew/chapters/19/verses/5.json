{"verse":"5","text":"And He said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall be turned into one flesh.’“Two”—not three, four, five, etc. “The two” refers to one man and one woman—not two men, a man and an animal, a woman and a demon, or whatever. The ‘one flesh’ is not just poetic language, it refers to a chemical reality."}

{"verse":"28","text":"So Jesus said to them: “Assuredly I say to you that in the Regeneration,I take it that Jesus is referring to His millennial reign, the Messianic Kingdom, when the earth will be ‘regenerated’, being restored to conditions reminiscent of Eden. For instance, if He does not regenerate the magnetic field that surrounds it pretty soon, life on this planet will become less and less viable. when the Son of the Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.I wonder who will occupy the Iscariot's throne? I see no reason to doubt that the Lord is being literal here."}

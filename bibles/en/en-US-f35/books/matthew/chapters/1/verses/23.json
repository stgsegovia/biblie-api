{"verse":"23","text":"“Behold, the virgin will become pregnant and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel”,The quote is from Isaiah 7:14. Matthew uses the Greek παρθενος, which unambiguously means ‘virgin’, to translate the Hebrew ‘alma’, which is ambiguous—it refers to a young woman who may be a virgin, but not necessarily. Isaiah did not use bethulah, which refers unambiguously to a virgin, because, I suppose, the context demands an immediate fulfillment, which was supplied by Isaiah's wife, as the next chapter makes clear. It follows that translations of Isaiah 7:14 that render ‘young woman’ are not doing violence to the Hebrew Text. which being translated is, ‘God with us’.‘God with us’ is stronger than ‘God is with us’; Jesus was literally God living among us."}

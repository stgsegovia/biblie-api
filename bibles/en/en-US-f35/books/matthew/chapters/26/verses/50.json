{"verse":"50","text":"So Jesus said to him, “Friend, what brings you here?”Jesus knew perfectly well why Judas was there, so why did He call him “friend”? Perhaps to show that He held no personal animosity against him. Here read John 18:4-9. Jesus is clearly in control. They finally laid hands on Him only because He allowed it—it had to be; it was the Father's will. Then approaching they laid hands on Jesus and took Him."}

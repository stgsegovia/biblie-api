{"verse":"51","text":"And then, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest he cut off his ear!From John 18:10 we know that it was Peter, and that the servant was Malchus. The Text has ‘the servant’, so the high priest had probably put him in charge of the operation. Obviously Peter is not used to wielding a sword."}

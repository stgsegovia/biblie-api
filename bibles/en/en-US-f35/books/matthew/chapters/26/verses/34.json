{"verse":"34","text":"Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I say to you that this night, before any rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”The emphasis here is on the silence of all roosters until Peter denies at least three times. This is actually the third prediction—the first is in John 13:36-38 and the second is in Luke 22:31-34."}

{"verse":"25","text":"Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, “It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?” He says to him, “You said it!”Judas phrases his question just like the others, only saying ‘Rabbi’ instead of ‘Lord’. The Lord's answer confirms that it is Judas. Mark and Luke also record this incident, but the one recorded in John 13:21-30 happened later."}

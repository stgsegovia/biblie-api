{"verse":"13","text":"But different ones were jeering, saying, “They are full of sweet wine!”In ‘sweet’ wine the fermentation process was just beginning, so the alcohol content was still low; but if you drank enough of it you got ‘happy’. So the mockers are saying that the disciples had tanked up and were feeling the effects. (On the other hand, 120 bellyfuls would represent a respectable quantity of liquid, much more than would normally be available, so the mockers' hypothesis is not very plausible—and being drunk does not give you the ability to speak a different language [in fact, you don't even speak your own correctly].) But as Peter points out in verse 15, it was 9:00 a.m., too early for anyone to be drunk."}

{"verse":"23","text":"Him—being delivered up by the established purpose and foreknowledge of God—you murdered, having taken Him with lawless hands and crucified Him;“You took with lawless hands”—‘take’ and ‘lawless’ clearly give the idea that they were responsible for their actions. “Being delivered up by the established purpose and foreknowledge of God” is a clear statement of God's sovereignty in action. So here we have divine sovereignty and human responsibility side by side; they are both true, whether we understand it or not. (Less than 3% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit ‘having taken’.)"}

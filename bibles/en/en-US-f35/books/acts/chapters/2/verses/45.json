{"verse":"45","text":"they started selling both possessions and goods and were distributing to all according as anyone had need.No one wanted to go home to his own area; they did not want to miss anything (it appears that they were expecting the Lord's return at any moment). But what happens after all the goods and possessions have been sold? God sends persecution, and if there is nothing to leave behind it is easier to go somewhere else and start over."}

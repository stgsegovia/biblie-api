{"verse":"1","text":"When the day of Pentecost had come,This was no more than eight days after the Ascension. In John 14:18 the Lord had said, “I will not leave you orphans”—they only had to wait one week for the Holy Spirit; albeit on resurrection night Jesus had breathed on them at least a portion of the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). they were all together with one purpose.See 1:14 above. What was that ‘purpose’? I assume that they were obeying the Lord's command, they were waiting for ‘the promise of the Father’, the baptism with Holy Spirit."}

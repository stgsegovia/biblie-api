{"verse":"42","text":"And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles' teaching and in the fellowship, both in the breaking of the bread and in the prayers.I take “the breaking of the bread” to refer to the Lord's Supper, which with the “prayers” gives the content of the “fellowship”, but that fellowship cannot be disassociated from the Apostles' teaching."}

{"verse":"40","text":"With many different words he both testified and kept exhorting, saying, “Escape from this perverse generation!”The ‘generation’ in question was the one that had crucified the Messiah. By being baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ they would be formally disassociating themselves from that generation, and the judgment that was coming upon it. The worst curse in all human history is recorded in Matthew 27:25, “And all the people answered and said, ‘His blood be on us and on our children’.” Terrible, terrible, terrible—just terrible! (The persecutions later sent them scattering and probably very few were in Jerusalem when it was destroyed in AD 70.)"}

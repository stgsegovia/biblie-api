{"verse":"22","text":"“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Natsorean,‘Natsorean’, not ‘Nazarene’. The Text has ‘the’ Natsorean, the Branch-man (see Matthew 2:23 and Isaiah 11:1). In Acts 22:8 the glorified Jesus identifies Himself to Saul as ‘the Natsorean’, which Saul would understand as being the Messiah. a man from God attested to you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by Him in your midst, as you yourselves well know,Peter here addresses specifically the Israelites, presumably residents of Jerusalem and Judea, since they had been eyewitnesses of what Jesus did."}

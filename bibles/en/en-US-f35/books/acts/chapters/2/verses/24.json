{"verse":"24","text":"whom God raised up, ending the labor pains of death,In Revelation 1:5 Jesus is called “the firstborn from among the dead”. Death is pictured as a huge womb, pregnant with all the dead, and Jesus Christ was the first one out, literally the ‘firstborn’. Resurrection is the process by which one is ‘born’ out of physical death. The figure of death as a womb is strong, but effective. That ‘womb’ had been holding people for thousands of years, but now finally ‘gives birth’. (People like Lazarus who were returned to this life for a while had to die all over again; they have to wait for the resurrection like the rest of us.) because it was not possible that He should be held by it."}

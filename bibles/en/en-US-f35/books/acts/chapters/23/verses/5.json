{"verse":"5","text":"Then Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he is high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”See Exodus 22:28. Ananias was presumably the true high priest, but someone else was probably the political ‘high priest’ that year, and the political one would be wearing the priestly attire; presumably that is why Paul did not recognize the real high priest. Note that he sort of apologizes, but he does not revoke the curse!"}

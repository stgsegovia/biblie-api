{"verse":"9","text":"There was a great clamor, and the scribes of the Pharisee party stood up and started arguing vigorously, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man; but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God!”Some 4.5% of the Greek manuscripts omit ‘let us not fight against God’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

{"verse":"3","text":"Then Paul said to him: “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!One is reminded of the Lord's calling the Pharisees ‘whitewashed tombs’ (Matthew 23:27); what Paul said was probably not as bad, but definitely not a compliment! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you command me to be struck contrary to the law!”"}

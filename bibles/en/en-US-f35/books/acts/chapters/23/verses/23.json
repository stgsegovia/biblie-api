{"verse":"23","text":"Summoning two of the centurions he said: â€œPrepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmenA centurion commanded 100 men, so there were probably at least five centurions that set out with Paul. to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;Earlier in the book, referring to the Jewish hour of prayer, Hebrew time is used, and on that basis this would be 9 p.m. But I find it scarcely credible that a Roman commander (not a Jew) addressing his troops (none of whom were Jews) would use Hebrew time; I would expect him to use Roman time, which would make it 3 a.m. (People would still be awake at 9 p.m., but not at 3 a.m.)"}

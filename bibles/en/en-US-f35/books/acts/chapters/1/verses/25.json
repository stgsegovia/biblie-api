{"verse":"25","text":"to receive the portion of this ministry and apostleship, out of which Judas turned aside to go into his own place.”Judas turned aside “out of” Jesus' group, to go “into” his own place. Peter does not name the place, but the Lord Jesus had declared in their hearing that Judas was lost (John 17:12; see also Matthew 26:24)."}

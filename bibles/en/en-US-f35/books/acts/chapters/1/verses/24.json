{"verse":"24","text":"And praying they said: â€œYou, Lord, Knower of all hearts, show which one of these two You have chosenWait a minute! How do we, or Peter, know that holding that election was God's idea? If it was not God's idea then Matthias was not really God's choice. (Perhaps Peter did like we so often do, bring our ideas to God and ask Him to bless them, although Peter's idea was evidently based on Psalm 109:8.) In any case, this is the first and last time Matthias is mentioned in the New Testament. The original twelve were personally chosen by Jesus; the only other one so chosen was Saul/Paul."}

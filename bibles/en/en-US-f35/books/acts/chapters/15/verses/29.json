{"verse":"29","text":"to abstain from things offered to idols,The idols represented demons, and to deliberately worship an idol would give its demon a ‘legal’ basis for working in the worshiper. from ‘blood’, from anything strangled and from fornication;In the Greek Text each item in the list is a single word; such brevity could give rise to ambiguity. However, items 1 and 4 seem clear enough. Item 3 presumably harks back to Genesis 9:4, where ingesting blood is forbidden. So item 2, ‘blood’, must mean something else. In the Bible ‘blood’ is repeatedly used to refer to violent death and the responsibility for it. This harks back to Genesis 9:5-6. The prohibition against fornication is implied in Genesis 2:24. That God did not accept Cain's offering (Genesis 4:3-5) implies that He had given instruction on the subject, which would presumably include idolatry. So the four items in the list are all far older than the Law of Moses and are independent of it. it will be in your own best interest to keep away from these things."}

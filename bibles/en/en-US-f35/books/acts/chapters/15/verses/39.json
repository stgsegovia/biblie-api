{"verse":"39","text":"Well the contention became so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;This is the last we hear of Barnabas, but not of Mark. Barnabas was an encourager. He had seen the potential in Saul of Tarsus and helped him along on at least two occasions. Now he sees the potential in Mark and invests in him, to such good effect that Paul himself later recognizes Mark's value (2 Timothy 4:11). Peter had taken Mark under his wing and helped him write the second Gospel."}

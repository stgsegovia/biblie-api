{"verse":"8","text":"While Stephen, full of faithFor ‘faith’ some 20% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘grace’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.Would not signs and wonders already be miraculous, without being “great”? Stephen was something else! Please notice that Stephen was not an Apostle, so the doing of miracles was not limited to them. Stephen and Philip (chapter 8 below) were deacons."}

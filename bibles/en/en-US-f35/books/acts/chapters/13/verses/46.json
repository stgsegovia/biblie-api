{"verse":"46","text":"But Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly said: “It was necessary that God's Word should be spoken to you first.Note the “it was necessary”. The apostles had a clear conviction that the Jews should be given the first chance. But since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life,This sounds a little bit like sarcasm to me. now we are being turned to the Gentiles."}

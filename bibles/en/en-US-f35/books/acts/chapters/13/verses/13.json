{"verse":"13","text":"Then Paul and his party set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphilia (here John left them and returned to Jerusalem).When the party arrived in Cyprus, Barnabas was the leader; when it left, Paul had taken over. Barnabas was John's uncle, and quite possibly John did not like the change."}

A careful comparison of the relevant texts shows that the 400 years includes from the weaning of Isaac to the Exodus (1891 to 1491 bc); since Jacob moved to Egypt in 1706, Abraham's descendants were aliens in Canaan for 185 years, then were aliens in Egypt, where they came to be enslaved, for 215 years (the Exodus was 144 years after Joseph's death, so the period of slave labor was presumably somewhat less, perhaps around 100 years).

Assuming that Stephen's statement is correct (if he was full of the Spirit as he spoke, verse 55), then presumably Abraham actually bought both places, though Moses only records one, and Jacob was obliged to rebuy one or bought a larger area around it. A variety of historical records existed, made during OT times, that were not included in the Canon and of which we have no copies—but they were still available in Stephen's day. (For instance, Jude [verse 14] cites Enoch—we have no Hebrew copy of Enoch's prophecy today, but Jude must have had access to one.) In any case, notice that the Text says ‘they’ were taken to Shechem—this would refer to Jacob's sons, since he himself was buried at Hebron. Going back to Genesis 34:29, after killing all the men of Shechem, Jacob's sons kept the women, which is presumably where they got wives for so many men. They also got rich on the spoils of the town.

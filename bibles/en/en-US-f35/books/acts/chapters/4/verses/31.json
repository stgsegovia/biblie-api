{"verse":"31","text":"Well when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with Holy Spirit and spoke the Word of God with boldness.Their request was granted. Notice that the Holy Spirit's filling is not once for all, and is not automatic. Notice further that they did not ask for a free ride. (Again, there is no definite article with Holy Spirit.) But where did they do the speaking? Presumably out among the people."}

{"verse":"13","text":"Now upon observing the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were uneducated and unskilled men,The disciples had not received a theological education nor been trained in verbal skills (of course Peter was a skilled fisherman, but that is not the point here). they marveled; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus."}

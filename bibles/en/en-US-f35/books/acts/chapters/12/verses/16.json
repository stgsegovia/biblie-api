{"verse":"16","text":"But Peter kept on knocking; so when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded.They evidently did not expect their prayer to be answered. After all, they had probably prayed for James first, and he was killed anyway. When we pray about a difficult situation, we should start out by asking what the Father is doingâ€”John 5:19."}

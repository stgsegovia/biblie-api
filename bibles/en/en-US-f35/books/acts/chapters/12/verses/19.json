{"verse":"19","text":"Well after searching for him and not finding him, Herod examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Going down from Judea to Caesarea, he stayed there.He had doubtless told the Jews that he had Peter, and when he couldn't produce him he lost face. But the circumstances probably left him uncomfortable as well, so he decided to get away for awhileâ€”none of which saved the poor guards. The guards were part of an evil system, and presumably would never have converted (although, if Peter had preached to them, some may have believed before the execution)."}

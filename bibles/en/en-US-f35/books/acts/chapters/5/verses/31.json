{"verse":"31","text":"Him God has exalted to His right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.I was tempted to render, “to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel”, but the Text does not have that order (though it could have), perhaps so as not to limit the forgiveness of sins to Israel."}

{"verse":"20","text":"“Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.”That is what the Text says, “this Life”. To belong to Jesus not only means spiritual life in the place of spiritual death, but it means a way of life—a system of values, a set of presuppositions, a worldview."}

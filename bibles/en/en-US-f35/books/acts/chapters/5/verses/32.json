{"verse":"32","text":"And we are witnesses to these statements about Him, as also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those obeying Him.”The Apostles are impressive—no fear, no apology, no toning down. “You murdered Him!” “God raised Him!” “He is Prince and Savior!” “The Holy Spirit exists!” All these affirmations were things they absolutely did not want to hear, as their reaction attests. Many in our day do not want to hear that the Holy Spirit is given to those who obey God."}

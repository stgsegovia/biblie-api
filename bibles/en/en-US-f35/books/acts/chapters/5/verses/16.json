{"verse":"16","text":"Further, the multitude from the surrounding cities also kept coming into Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.This is reminiscent of the Lord's ministry, when all who came were healed. Should we be able to do this today, or is this a ‘special occasion’ sort of thing? How about when we introduce the Gospel to a new area or culture? Would not overt demonstrations of God's power speed up the process?"}

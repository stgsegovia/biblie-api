{"verse":"25","text":"But concerning the Gentiles who believe we have written, having judged that they need observe no such thing, exceptSome 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, omit ‘that they need observe no such thing except’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). that they should keep themselves from that offered to idols, from the blood, from anything strangled, and from fornication.”What happened here was exceedingly serious: to James there were two classes of Christian, Jew and non-Jew. He still sees the Jew as superior to the Gentile, which is contrary to the doctrine of the Church as expounded in Paul's letters, that we believe to be inspired. To James it was not enough for a Jew to believe into Jesus; he still had to obey the Law of Moses and the Jewish customs. This was evidently the prevailing view in Jerusalem and environs. Such a view actually represented rebellion against God. Then came judgment: Jerusalem was destroyed, which included its church, and the Aegean area became the heartland of the Church. For centuries Judea was no more than a backwater on the fringes of the Christian river."}

{"verse":"26","text":"Now upon arriving in Jerusalem Saul kept trying to join himself to the disciples;I get the impression that he made repeated efforts; after all, he probably had a very good idea of where different groups could be found. Either he didn't know where the apostles were, or lacked the courage to approach them. It was probably after several efforts that Barnabas got wind of what was happening; however, the news doubtless spread through the community quite quickly. but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple."}

{"verse":"20","text":"Immediately he started proclaiming Jesus‘Jesus’ is read by Family 35 and the earliest MSS, albeit representing only some 20% of the Greek MSS here; the rest have ‘the Christ’. To teach that the Messiah was the Son of God would be ‘old hat’, no problem—but Saul was showing that Jesus was God's Son. Notice the end of verse 22, “this One is the Christ”—what is the antecedent of “this”? To say that the Christ is the Christ would be stupid, which neither of the authors is. in the synagogues, that He is the Son of the God."}

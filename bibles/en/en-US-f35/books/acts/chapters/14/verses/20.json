{"verse":"20","text":"But as the disciples stood around him,I suppose that the attack was sudden and unexpected (planned that way), so the disciples did not have time to try to defend him. Paul certainly looked dead, but as the disciples were standing there trying to assimilate what had happened, he got up! His recovery was such that he could set out the next day on foot. he got up and entered the city. The next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."}

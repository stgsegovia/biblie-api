{"verse":"5","text":"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the Spirit,Instead of ‘Spirit’, some 6% of the Greek manuscripts read ‘word’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.) solemnly insisting to the Jews: Jesus is the Christ.Paul could now turn physical details over to Silas and Timothy (who evidently did not get to Athens before Paul left there) and concentrate on the spiritual. The Holy Spirit has him really bear down on the Jews, obliging them to make a choice. Paul then turned his full attention to the Gentile population."}

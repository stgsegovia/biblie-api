{"verse":"33","text":"In that same hour of the night he took them aside and washed their wounds, and thereupon he and all his family were baptized.Very appropriateâ€”he washed their wounds and restored their dignity, so they could baptize him. Note again that baptism followed immediately. (Would there have been enough water there to dunk them? Probably not.) Note that everyone in the family was baptized, which would put them under Christ's protection, but that procedure was imposed by the head of the household, whether or not there was personal commitment to Jesus on the part of each one."}

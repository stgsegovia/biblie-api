{"verse":"13","text":"On the Sabbath day we went outside the city by a river, where prayer was customarily made,Instead of “where prayer was customarily made”, perhaps 2% if the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, have ‘where we supposed a place of prayer to be’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). and sitting down we started speaking to the assembled women.Evidently there was no synagogue in Philippi. Prayer meetings usually have more women than men."}

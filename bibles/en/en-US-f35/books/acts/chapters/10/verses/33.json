{"verse":"33","text":"So I sent to you at once, and you did well to come. Now then, we are all present before God to hear all the things commanded you by God.”Cornelius does not beat around the bush, he wants to hear from God. Instead of ‘God’ some 5% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘the Lord’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

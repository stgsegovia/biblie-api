{"verse":"12","text":"in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth (both wild animals and reptiles) and birds of the sky.What the Text actually says, literally, is: “all the four-footed of the earth, and the wild animals, and the reptiles, and the birds of the sky”—a rerun of Noah's ark! Well, if the sheet were large enough… However, from Peter's response it appears that no ‘clean’ animals or birds were included. I am tempted to translate: “all the four-footed of the earth—that is, the wild animals and the reptiles—and the birds of the sky” wherein the ‘birds of the sky’ are carrion fowl (songbirds and game birds generally stay close to the ground)."}

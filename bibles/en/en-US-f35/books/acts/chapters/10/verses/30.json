{"verse":"30","text":"So Cornelius said: “I have been fastingSome 3.5% of the Greek manuscripts omit the ‘fasting’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). during four days until this very hour; yes, it was the ninth hour,“I have been fasting during four days until this very hour” (the first card) and “the ninth hour…” (the second card). About the sequence, we observe the following: verse 3—1st day: Cornelius sees angel, about 3 p.m., and sends messengers forthwith; verse 9—2nd day: Peter has vision, after 12 noon, and messengers arrive (& are lodged for the night); verse 23—3rd day: Peter and company leave Joppa; verse 24—4th day: they enter Caesarea (probably before noon). So, by western reckoning we have not quite three full days, but by Hebrew and Brazilian reckoning we have a situation that involves four days. The messengers, under urgent orders, did the 60 km in under 24 hours (whether they went all night, we do not know, but they were probably obviously tired when they showed up at Peter's gate). Peter was not about to be stampeded into action; he had to eat, sort things out in his mind, talk it over with the others—since they decided to send a committee, preparations had to be made. So they set out the next day, but they are dignified Jews and are not going to run—they set a steady pace and probably make some 45 km before stopping for the night. The remaining 15 km they knock off before noon the next day. So, the “this very hour” refers to the time of Peter's arrival.

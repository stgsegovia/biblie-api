{"verse":"32","text":"Well when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some started scoffing,Satan hates the resurrection, and people controlled by him almost always react adversely to it (as Festus will do in chapter 26). while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”Evidently they never got another chance. People who try to impose their agenda on God usually do not do very well."}

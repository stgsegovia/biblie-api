{"verse":"31","text":"because He has appointed a day in which He will judge the inhabited world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained; He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”The resurrection of Jesus is central to our Faith for several reasons. Here Paul says it guarantees that we will be judged, righteously."}

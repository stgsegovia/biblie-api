{"verse":"29","text":"Therefore, since we are God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold or silver or stoneâ€”something shaped by human skill and imagination.If we are God's offspring He must have all the capabilities we have, only bigger and better; and we are not metal or stone."}

{"verse":"20","text":"and that He may send Jesus, who had been ordained to be your Messiah,That is what the Text says. There was God's side, ordaining, and there was their side, recognizing and receiving. If Jesus had been received as Messiah while He lived among them, presumably history would have been different. But now Jesus will only return when it is time to ‘restore all things’. But comparing the first clause of verse 19 with that of verse 20 it almost seems that Peter is saying that they could bring Jesus back right away."}

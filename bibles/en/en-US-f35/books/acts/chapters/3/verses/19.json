{"verse":"19","text":"Repent therefore, and turn around, so that your sins may be erased, in order that times of refreshing may come from the Lord's faceAlthough the Lord's return is still future, by His grace, and by walking in the Spirit, we have the privilege of experiencing our own little ‘times of refreshing’."}

{"verse":"9","text":"But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor,I wonder if those Jews had been involved in the decision to replace Felix (who didn't play ball with them) with Festus. If so, and if Festus was aware that he owed them a favor, that would account for his attitude here. answered Paul by saying, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be judged by me there concerning these things?”"}

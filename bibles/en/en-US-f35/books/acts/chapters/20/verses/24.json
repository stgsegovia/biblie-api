{"verse":"24","text":"However none of this moves me, nor do I regard my life as valuable to myself,Paul's statement is a non sequitur. When the Holy Spirit gives repeated warnings, He is telling us to STOP! just so that I may complete my course with joy,How can you complete your course with joy if you are disobedient? He is not thinking clearly. Some 3% of the Greek manuscripts omit ‘with joy’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). even the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to solemnly proclaim the Good News of the grace of God."}

{"verse":"35","text":"In every way I showed you that working hard like this it is necessary to help the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”This precise statement is not recorded in the Gospels, but Paul got it from one of those who actually heard it. It is an important truth. (Compare Luke 14:12-14.)"}

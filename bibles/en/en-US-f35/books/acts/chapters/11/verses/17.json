{"verse":"17","text":"So if God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed upon the Lord Jesus,Notice that there is no mention of keeping the Law, being circumcised, or following Jewish customs. Peter is saying that what God did indicates that the key to salvation is believing upon the Lord Jesus, whether Jew or Gentile. I follow the best line of transmission that reads ‘the Lord Jesus’; some 75% of the Greek manuscripts add ‘Christ’. who was I to be able to withstand God?”"}

{"verse":"40","text":"Philip was found at Azotus,The verb is in the passive voice, but I am tempted to translate, ‘found himself’. The Spirit put Philip down in a nearby town, perhaps 10-15 miles away. Caesarea was some 50 miles on up the coast; speaking of which, Philip evidently decided to settle there. and as he passed through he evangelized all the towns until he came to Caesarea."}

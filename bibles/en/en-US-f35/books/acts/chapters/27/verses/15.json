{"verse":"15","text":"Well the ship was caught and could not head into the wind, so we gave up and were driven along.The blast of wind was sudden and they were too close to the shore to have much room to maneuver. To remain broadside to the wind was to be swamped, so they turned tail and the wind drove them out to the open Mediterranean. I imagine that a little supernatural activity was involved."}

{"verse":"16","text":"And now, why hesitate? Get up, be baptized and wash away your sins, invoking the name of the Lord.’By invoking the Lord he was placing himself under His direction and protection, which was what took care of his sins, not the baptism. There probably was not enough water in the house for a complete bath, in any case, so the baptism was by aspersion (as it was in the house of Cornelius, the house of the Philippian jailor, etc. etc.). Instead of ‘of the Lord’, some 6% of the Greek manuscripts read ‘his’ (as in NIV, NASB, TEV, etc.)."}

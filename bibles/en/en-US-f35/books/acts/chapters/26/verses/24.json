{"verse":"24","text":"Well as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice: “Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!”Festus in not happy. Paul is talking to Agrippa, not to him. As a ‘son of the disobedience’ (Ephesians 2:2) he was open to demonic interference, and Satan does not like the resurrection. So Paul's mention of Jesus' resurrection is Festus' clue to interrupt, which he does in rather insulting terms."}

{"verse":"6","text":"Further, God spoke like this: that his offspring would be aliens in a foreign land—and that they would be enslaved and oppressed—four hundred years.Stephen cites Genesis 15:13, which should be understood as a chiasmus, a frequent structure in the Bible: A. his offspring would be aliens in a foreign land B. and they would be enslaved B. and oppressed A. four hundred years. A careful comparison of the relevant texts shows that the 400 years includes from the weaning of Isaac to the Exodus (1891 to 1491 bc); since Jacob moved to Egypt in 1706, Abraham's descendants were aliens in Canaan for 185 years, then were aliens in Egypt, where they came to be enslaved, for 215 years (the Exodus was 144 years after Joseph's death, so the period of slave labor was presumably somewhat less, perhaps around 100 years). (I owe the understanding given above to Dr. Floyd N. Jones.)"}

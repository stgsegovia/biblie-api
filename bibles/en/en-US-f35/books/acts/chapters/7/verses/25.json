{"verse":"25","text":"Now he supposed that his brothers understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand,This evaluation of Moses' thinking is not in the OT, at least not at this juncture. Did Moses really suppose that killing an Egyptian would make a difference, or that God would give deliverance in that way? When we see him in heaven we can ask him. But comparing this with verse 23 above we may conclude that it was God who put the idea of visiting his people in his heart. but they did not understand."}

{"verse":"4","text":"Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and resided in Haran.But he took his father and a nephew along, and Haran was not that land. ‘Our father Abraham’—the Jews began their history with Abraham, who started out with incomplete obedience. From there, after his father died,There went fifteen years of his life. And he took his nephew Lot along, who would be a big headache (he fathered the Moabites and the Ammonites—not good news—under circumstances that would not have happened had he been left in Haran). God moved him to this land in which you now live;Stephen ties his hearers into the story."}

{"verse":"23","text":"Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.Comparing Hebrews 11:24-26, it appears that Moses had formally refused the status of being the son of Pharaoh's daughter, with the political and other advantages pertaining to that status. This attitude probably did not sit well with Pharaoh, which is why he was prepared to kill Moses, when the opportunity presented itself."}

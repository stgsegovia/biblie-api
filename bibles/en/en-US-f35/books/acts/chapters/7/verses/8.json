{"verse":"8","text":"And He gave him a covenant of circumcision;Women whose husbands are circumcised do not get cervical cancer—the procedure is not a sadistic bit of gore; there is a medical reason for it. and so he begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day;Modern medicine has verified that on the eighth day of a male's life his defenses against infection are at their peak—it is the best day in his whole life for minor surgery. Now then, 3900 years ago who but the Creator could know that? and Isaac did the same to Jacob, and Jacob to the twelve patriarchs."}

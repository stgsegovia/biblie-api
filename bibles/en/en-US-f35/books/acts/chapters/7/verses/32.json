{"verse":"32","text":"‘I am the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’See Exodus 3:6. The Lord Jesus made use of this passage to demonstrate the fact of resurrection (Matthew 22:32). Perhaps 5% of the Greek manuscripts omit “the God” before Isaac and Jacob (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). Moses started trembling and did not dare to look."}

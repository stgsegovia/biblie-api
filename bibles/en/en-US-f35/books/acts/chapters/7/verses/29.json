{"verse":"29","text":"Well Moses fled at that word, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.I find Stephen's selection of details to be curious. Moses' two sons were not prominent in the history of Israel, so why mention them? Well, Moses' failure to circumcise them almost cost him his life! See Exodus 4:24-26. Although Moses himself was certainly circumcised as a baby, he was brought up as an Egyptian, and the importance of the procedure had not been ingrained in him; his wife was not an Israelite and was against it. But how could Moses lead the covenant people while ignoring the sign of the covenant?"}

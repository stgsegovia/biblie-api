{"verse":"21","text":"Because He made the One who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become God's righteousness.Here we are face to face with the mystery of our redemption. Jesus, God's Son, never sinned, did not ‘know’ sin, experientially, but He was “made to be sin” on our behalf. It is a grim picture, as though on the cross He was changed into a bundle of sin. And in exchange He gave us His righteousness. How can we ‘measure’ or understand such love? It is beyond our comprehension. As Romans 11:33 expresses it: “Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!”"}

{"verse":"5","text":"Now it is God who has prepared us for this very purpose, who also has given us the down payment of the Spirit.If you don't have the Holy Spirit, you don't have a ‘contract’. He is the down payment on ‘the Life’ (verse 4); eternal life being a quality of life, we can start living it down here."}

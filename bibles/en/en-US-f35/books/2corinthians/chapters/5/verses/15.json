{"verse":"15","text":"and He died for all so that those who now live should no longer live for themselves but for the One who died for allI follow the best line of transmission, along with a minority of the manuscript total (35% here), in reading “all” instead of the familiar ‘them’. and was raised again.The clearest statements giving why Christ died begin with Romans 14:9, “that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living”; followed by this verse, that we should no longer live for ourselves, but for Him. Philippians 2:8-11 refers to the final victory. Hebrews 2:14 refers to destroying Satan; saving us from hell is a by-product. As it says in Romans 10:9, “if you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord…’, you will be saved”."}

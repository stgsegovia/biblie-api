{"verse":"7","text":"by truthful speech, by God's power, with the weapons of the righteousness in the right hand and in the left;Why right and left? A right-handed soldier would have a shield in his left hand, for defense, with a sword or spear in his right, for offenseâ€”our weapons are for both offense and defense."}

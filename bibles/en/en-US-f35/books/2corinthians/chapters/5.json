That holiness is truly intimidating, and we will all be judged by it. Jonathan Edwards preached on that basis, with extraordinary effect, but there are few in our day who follow his example. On a lower level, worldly people tend to feel uncomfortable in the presence of someone who is holy, sometimes to the point of reacting aggressively. As Satan increases his hold on the world, such aggressive reaction will become ever more common. we try to convince people."},{"book":"2 Corinthians","chapter":"5","verse":"12","text":"We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.Paul will enlarge on this later on in the letter."},{"book":"2 Corinthians","chapter":"5","verse":"13","text":"If we are ‘out of our senses’, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you."},{"book":"2 Corinthians","chapter":"5","verse":"14","text":"For Christ's love impels us, having concluded this: if One died for all it follows that all died;They all died in Him; just like all sinned in Adam."},{"book":"2 Corinthians","chapter":"5","verse":"15","text":"and He died for all so that those who now live should no longer live for themselves but for the One who died for allI follow the best line of transmission, along with a minority of the manuscript total (35% here), in reading “all” instead of the familiar ‘them’. and was raised again.The clearest statements giving why Christ died begin with Romans 14:9, “that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living”; followed by this verse, that we should no longer live for ourselves, but for Him. Philippians 2:8-11 refers to the final victory. Hebrews 2:14 refers to destroying Satan; saving us from hell is a by-product.

Jesus, God's Son, never sinned, did not ‘know’ sin, experientially, but He was “made to be sin” on our behalf. It is a grim picture, as though on the cross He was changed into a bundle of sin. And in exchange He gave us His righteousness. How can we ‘measure’ or understand such love? It is beyond our comprehension. As Romans 11:33 expresses it: “Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!”"}]}

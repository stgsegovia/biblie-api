{"verse":"13","text":"not like Moses, who put a veil over his own face, so that the children of Israel would not observe the end of what was fading.At first he used the veil because the people found the shine to be disconcerting, but the shine faded, and he kept on using the veil so they couldn't see that it was gone. Any reflected light depends on the source, and constant exposure to that source."}

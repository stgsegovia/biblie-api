{"verse":"18","text":"So we all, contemplating as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with unveiled face,Comparing this text with others like Psalm 1:2-3, James 1:22-25, 2:12, Ephesians 6:17 and Hebrews 4:12, I conclude that the ‘mirror’ here refers to God's Word. As we spend time in the Word with “unveiled face” (sincerely open to what it says), the Holy Spirit moves us up from one plane of glory to another—the goal is “the same image”. are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, precisely from Lord Spirit.Had Paul been writing in Hebrew, I imagine we would have ‘Jehovah-Spirit’, or ‘Jehovah the Spirit’. He here reinforces what he already said in verse 17—the Holy Spirit is part of the Triune God."}

{"verse":"3","text":"you are manifestly a letter of Christ, mediated by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God,In some sense all of us are ‘letters’ that those around us read. To the extent that we invest in others, build into their lives, we contribute to their ‘letters’. Of course it is our lives that people see, not what is inscribed on the heart. not on stone tablets but on ‘tablets’ that are hearts of flesh.)"}

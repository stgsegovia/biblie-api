{"verse":"6","text":"indeed, He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant;Note that Paul is clearly aware that he is promoting a new covenant. The old covenant was characterized by “letter”, while the new is characterized by “Spirit” (or “spirit”). not of letter but of Spirit, because the letter kills, while the Spirit gives life.I have capitalized ‘Spirit’, but ‘spirit’ is also true. The ‘spirit’ of a message has to do with its purpose, which should take into consideration the local context."}

{"verse":"21","text":"that when I come again my God may not humble me before you, and I will mourn for many who have previously sinned and not repented of the impurity and fornication and licentiousness which they practiced.There is only one definite article for the three nouns, and ‘which’ is singular, so the three are regarded as a single ‘package’. Unfortunately there have always been, and continue to be, those who go back to a sinful lifestyle, and stay there. Like Paul, about all we can do for such is ‘mourn’."}

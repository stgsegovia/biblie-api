{"verse":"9","text":"But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more cheerfully about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may take up residence upon me.That is what the Text says, ‘take up residence’. I would say that for most of us unusual manifestations of God's power are sporadic (if there are any at all)—if the power ‘takes up residence’, the manifestations should be a regular occurrence. The trouble is, there is evidently a considerable price in suffering that must be paid."}

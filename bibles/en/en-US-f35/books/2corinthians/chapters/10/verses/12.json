{"verse":"12","text":"Now we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.If you compare yourself with a weakling, you can tell yourself that you are strong, which could get you beaten up. In any case, our standard is “the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13)."}

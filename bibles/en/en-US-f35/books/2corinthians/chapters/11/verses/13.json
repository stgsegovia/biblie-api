{"verse":"13","text":"Such men are really false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into ‘apostles’ of Christ.There have always been those who want to ‘get on the bandwagon’, to get a free ride; who traffic in spiritual things for personal, temporal advantage. Since such people only do damage, Paul's desire to expose them stems from his concern for the Corinthians' welfare."}

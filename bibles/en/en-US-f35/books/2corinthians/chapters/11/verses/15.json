{"verse":"15","text":"So it is no great thing if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness,It is well to remember that neither Satan nor his servants are in the habit of appearing with horns and tails. Just because someone ‘looks good’ doesn't mean that he is. whose end will be according to their works."}

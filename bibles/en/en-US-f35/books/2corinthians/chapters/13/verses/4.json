{"verse":"4","text":"(although He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God). Now we also are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God toward you.Being weak in God's presence is one thing; being weak in our work for Him is quite another. I take Paul to be saying that being weak in God's presence triggers the outflow of His power in our work."}

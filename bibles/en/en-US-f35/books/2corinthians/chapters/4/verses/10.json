{"verse":"10","text":"always carrying about in the body the putting to death of the LordPerhaps 5% of the Greek manuscripts omit “Lord”, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc. Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body.One is reminded of 1 Corinthians 15:31, where Paul says, “I die daily”. Clearly he cannot be referring to physical death, so it must be a dying to self. As I die to myself, to my own ideas and desires, the life of Jesus will be manifested in and through me. Or as he put it in Galatians 2:20, “I have been crucified with Christ, so it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me; what I now live in this body I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself in my place.”"}

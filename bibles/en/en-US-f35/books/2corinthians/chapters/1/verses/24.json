{"verse":"24","text":"(Not that we have control over your faith,This is an important point: in Matthew 23:8-10 the Lord Jesus forbids any attempt to dominate someone else's faith or conscience. As He said to the Samaritan woman, the Father wants worship in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24)â€”the worship must not be faked, forced or controlled. but we work with you for your joy, for it is by faith that you stand firm.)"}

{"verse":"14","text":"(as indeed some of you have acknowledged) that we are your boast, just as you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.Paul seems to be speaking of a reciprocal boasting, and that before Christ's Judgment Seat! We probably all know a father and son who are proud of each other; the idea may be similar."}

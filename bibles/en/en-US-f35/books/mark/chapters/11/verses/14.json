{"verse":"14","text":"So Jesus reacted by saying to it, “Let no one ever eat fruit from you again!”Dear me; it would seem to be unreasonable to curse a tree out of season—it was not the tree's fault that it had no figs! First, being the Creator, Jesus had the right to do as He did; but second, it was probably a prophetic act wherein the fig tree represented Israel; and third, He wanted to teach His disciples about faith. And His disciples were listening."}

{"verse":"17","text":"And He kept teaching them by saying: “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’?See Isaiah 56:7. Note that it has always been God's intention that the whole world know and worship Him. but you have made it ‘a den of robbers’!”See Jeremiah 7:11. I get the impression that He kept repeating this as He went about His task."}

{"verse":"27","text":"But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first; it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.”Big dogs would not be in the house, so these would be little house pets, or perhaps puppies. This episode always moves me. In effect, Jesus called the woman a ‘dog’ (that is what Jews called Gentiles), and she accepted the classification. She was determined to get her ‘crumb’, and she did! And she left us a great example of humility and faith!"}

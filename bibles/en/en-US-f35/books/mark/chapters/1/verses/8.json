{"verse":"8","text":"I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with Holy Spirit.”There is no definite article with Holy Spirit, so I take it that we should consider the phrase as a proper name. Two baptisms are here contrasted: 1) John the agent with water as the vehicle; 2) Jesus the agent with the Holy Spirit as the vehicle. A baptism where the Holy Spirit is the agent is distinct from these. But how and when does Jesus baptize us with the Holy Spirit? He does so from His position at the Father's right hand, when we believe into Him. From then on the Spirit indwells us, and is closely associated with our ‘new man’."}

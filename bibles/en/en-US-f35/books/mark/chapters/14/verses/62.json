{"verse":"62","text":"So Jesus said: “I am, and you will see the Son of the Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven.”Wow! Jesus gave him more than he asked for! But how and when will those men, certainly lost, “see the Son of the Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of the heaven”? They will still be in Hades when Christ returns. Will those in Hades be able to see what goes on outside? I don't have an answer."}

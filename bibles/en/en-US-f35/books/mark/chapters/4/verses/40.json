{"verse":"40","text":"And He said to them: “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”Jesus is evidently saying that they should not have been afraid, and that they themselves could have solved the problem—if they had the faith. I imagine that the Lord would say something similar to us, when we fail to respond appropriately to difficult circumstances that take us by surprise."}

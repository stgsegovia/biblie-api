{"verse":"34","text":"And He said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go into peaceThat is what the Text says, ‘into’ not ‘in’. To go in peace is to leave on good terms, no hard feelings. But what might going into peace be? I would say that you take the peace with you; you live within an atmosphere of peace. Now that is a proper ‘blessing’! and be healed from your affliction.”"}

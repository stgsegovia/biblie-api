{"verse":"9","text":"Then He asked him, “What is your name?” And he answered, saying, “LegionA full Roman legion was 6,000 men, but many legions had only half that many. On the basis of verse 12, one wonders if there could have been 2,000 demons. This being the only recorded instance where Jesus asked a demon's name, I wonder why He did. Since He presumably already knew, I take it that He did it so we would have a record of demonic infestation. I see no basis here for needing to know a demon's name before you can cast it out. is my name, because we are many.”"}

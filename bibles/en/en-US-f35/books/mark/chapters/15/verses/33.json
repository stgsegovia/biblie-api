{"verse":"33","text":"Now when the sixth hour had come [noon], darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.The darkness could not have been a solar eclipse, as some have ignorantly argued. The Passover always occurs at full moon, and a solar eclipse only occurs at new moon. Further, even a total eclipse only lasts for a few minutes, not three hours."}

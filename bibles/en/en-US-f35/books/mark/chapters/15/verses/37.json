{"verse":"37","text":"Then Jesus gave a loud shout and breathed out His spirit;Both Matthew 27:50 and John 19:30 plainly state that Jesus dismissed His spirit. It was not the cross that killed Him [see the third note down]. As He Himself said in John 10:18, “No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.” He chose to die so that we might live. Thank you, Lord!"}

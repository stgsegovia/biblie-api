{"verse":"1","text":"As soon as it was early morning, having already formed a plan, the chief priests with the elders and scribes, indeed the whole council, bound Jesus, led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.And just why was Pilate dressed and waiting for them at 5:30 in the morning? Obviously this was a put up job. Pilate knew it was a farce, but he soon found himself in over his head. For a detailed analysis concerning Pilate, please see the Appendix: Poor Pilateâ€”wrong place, wrong time."}

{"verse":"38","text":"and the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.That veil represented the barrier between sinful man and a Holy God. For it to be ripped in two from top to bottom was obviously a supernatural event, and it followed immediately upon Jesus' deathâ€”which means that the Father considered that Jesus had solved the problem. Hebrews 10:20 makes the connection. Because of Jesus' death we can now have access to the Father."}

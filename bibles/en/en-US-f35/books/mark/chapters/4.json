The Lord Jesus declares that it is impossible to steal Satan's goods unless we bind him first. (From His use of “no one” it seems clear that the Lord is enunciating a general principle or truth.) And what might the nature of those ‘goods’ be? In the context (see Matthew 12:22-24) Jesus had delivered someone from a demon that caused blindness and dumbness, and in their comments the scribes and Pharisees include other instances where Jesus had expelled demons—it seems clear that the ‘goods’ are people who are subject to Satan's power, in one way or another. Thus we have the same essential truth as that declared in Acts 26:18—we have to do something about Satan's power over a person so that he or she can be saved! But what does Satan do to people that makes it necessary to “bind” him? We find the answer in 2 Corinthians 4:4. Let us begin with verse 3: “If our gospel is veiled it is veiled to them who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine in them.” The Text clearly states that Satan, ‘the god of this world’, is in the business of blinding the minds of unbelievers when they hear the Gospel, so they will not understand, so they will not be convicted, so they will not repent and convert. This is a terrible truth, the most terrible truth in the world, at least as I see it. The enemy has access to our minds, access in the sense that he has the power or ability to invade them, whether by introducing thoughts or by jamming our reasoning. The Lord Jesus declared this truth when He explained the parable of the sower. “These are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown; but, as soon as they hear it Satan comes and takes away the Word that was planted in their hearts” (Mark 4:15). In the parallel passage in Luke 8:12 Jesus adds the following words: “lest they believe and be saved”. Note that the Word is already in the mind or heart of the person, but then Satan comes, invades the mind and “takes away” that Word. I am not sure just how this intrusion by the enemy works, perhaps he causes a mental block of some sort, but the practical effect is that the Word becomes ineffective, as if the person had not even heard it. Perhaps 3% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, read ‘them’, instead of ‘their hearts’ (to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"16","text":"Similarly, these are the ones sown on the rocky area: as soon as they hear the Word they receive it with joy,"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"17","text":"but since they have no root in themselves they are temporary—when oppression or persecution comes because of the Word, they quickly fall away.Note that with both the stones and the thorns, the seed did germinate; there was life."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"18","text":"And these are the ones sown among the thorns: they hear the Word,"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"19","text":"but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the undue desires for other things come in and smother the Word, and it becomes unfruitful."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"20","text":"And these are the ones sown on the good ground: such people hear the Word, welcome it and produce fruit—thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"21","text":"Also He said to them: “The lamp is not brought to be put under a boxThe reference is to a peck measure, whether a box or a basket (or a basin). or under a bed, is it?

To object that tobacco and orchid seeds are smaller is beside the point."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"32","text":"yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs and produces big branches, so that the birds of the air are able to rest in its shade.”The verb I have rendered ‘to rest’ is a compound form. The noun root refers to a temporary shelter, like a tent or a hut. The verbal form means to make use of such a shelter. Here the preposition κατα is prefixed to the verb, emphasizing, as I suppose, the temporariness. The Text says that the birds can use the shade, not the branches. But shade moves with the sun, and with the wind—how can you build a nest in something that keeps moving around (the Text actually says ‘under its shade’)?"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"33","text":"It was with many such parables that He was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"34","text":"But apart from a parable He did not speak to them; privately, however, He would explain everything to His disciples."},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"35","text":"On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”"},{"book":"Mark","chapter":"4","verse":"36","text":"Since He was already in the boat,Going back to 4:1, He was already in the boat.

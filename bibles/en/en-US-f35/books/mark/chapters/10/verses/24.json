{"verse":"24","text":"But the disciples were astounded at His words. So Jesus tried again and said to them: “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in richesFive Greek manuscripts (all of objectively inferior quality), against 1650, omit ‘for those who trust in riches’, producing an obviously inferior text, but even so they are followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc. NIV favors us with a footnote: “Some manuscripts is for those who trust in riches”. They use ‘some’ to refer to the 1,650, against only five. Is that not a dishonest use of the English language? (There are probably hundreds of such footnotes.) to enter the Kingdom of God."}

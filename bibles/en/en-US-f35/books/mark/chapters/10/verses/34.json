{"verse":"34","text":"and they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And on the third day He will rise again.”Jesus knew perfectly well that this was His last trip to Jerusalem, and He had detailed knowledge of what would happen. (He had been given the word by Moses and Elijah—Luke 9:31.)"}

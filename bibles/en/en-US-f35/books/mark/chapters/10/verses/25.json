{"verse":"25","text":"It is actually easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”Ouch! In the Old Testament it was expected that godly living would be accompanied by material blessing. The trouble is that we tend to get more attached to the blessing than to the Blessor. Our Lord's words in Matthew 6:24 are to the point: “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.” Anyone who serves ‘mammon’ is not serving God, and therefore is not in the Kingdom. As for the ‘camel’ and the ‘needle’, there have been attempts to explain this away, but since Jesus went on to say it was “impossible”, we may take them literally."}

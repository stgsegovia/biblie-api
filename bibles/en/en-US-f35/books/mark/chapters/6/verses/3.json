{"verse":"3","text":"Isn't this the carpenter,They call Jesus ‘the carpenter’, so Joseph had died. the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas and Simon? And aren't his sisters here with us?”I placed all the statements within a single set of quotes, but they probably came from different people. Four brothers are named, and ‘sisters’ is plural, so there were at least two of them (Matthew 13:56 has “all his sisters”, so there were probably more than two). After Jesus, Joseph and Mary had a full family. So they took offense at Him."}

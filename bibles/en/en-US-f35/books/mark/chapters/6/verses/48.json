{"verse":"48","text":"And He sawIt was night, and they were about eight miles away, so this was supernatural vision. them straining at rowing, because the wind was against them. Well about the fourth watch of the nightThat was 3 a.m.! He comes to them walking on the water, and would have passed by them;They had been rowing for about nine hours, and when Jesus sent them off He presumably knew what was going to happen. (We should not be surprised if God does similar things with us.) He obviously intended for them to see Him, otherwise He would not have come near enough. But He did not go straight at the boat, but was walking off to one side. Just why He did it that way, the Text does not say, but from the parallel accounts we know that it gave Peter a chance to try a walk. As soon as He got in the boat it was transported several miles to the shore, immediately (John 6:21)."}

{"verse":"20","text":"because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a just and holy man. And consulting him he would do many things;I here follow the best line of transmission, albeit representing only 20% of the Greek manuscripts, that has ‘consulting’ in the present tense; the rest, followed by all versions, have the verb in the past. But the immediately following ‘he would do many things’ is attested by over 99%—a mere handful (0.4%), of objectively inferior quality, have ‘greatly disturbed’ or ‘very perplexed’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). But why then did Herod hear John with pleasure, and why was he ‘very sorry’ (verse 26)? But what sorts of things would Herod take to John for his opinion? I suggest that Herod used John as a sounding board for administrative problems, and since he often followed his advice, he had an unusually good administration, there for a while. That is why he was genuinely sorry to lose John. indeed, he would hear him with pleasure."}

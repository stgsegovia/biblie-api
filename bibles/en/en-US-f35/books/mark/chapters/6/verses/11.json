{"verse":"11","text":"And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them.Note that this is a command. Paul did this at least once (Acts 13:51), and the Lord Jesus Himself gave the example (Matthew 11:23-24), except that He spoke the curse. (I have had occasion to do it, and the consequences were serious.) Assuredly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city.‚ÄùPerhaps 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit the last sentence of verse 11, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc."}

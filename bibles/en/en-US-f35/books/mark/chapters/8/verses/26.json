{"verse":"26","text":"Then He sent him away to his house, saying, “Neither go into the village nor tell anyone in the village.”Evidently he did not live in that village. A small handful (0.5%) of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit ‘nor tell anyone in the village’, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc."}

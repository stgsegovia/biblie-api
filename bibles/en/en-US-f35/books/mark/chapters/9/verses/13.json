{"verse":"13","text":"Still, I say to you that ‘Elijah’ has also come, and they did to him as they wished, as it is written about him.”The Lord stated plainly that the coming of the real Elijah was still future. Since the Baptizer was Messiah's herald at His first advent, Jesus refers to him as ‘Elijah’ (recall that John was already dead)."}

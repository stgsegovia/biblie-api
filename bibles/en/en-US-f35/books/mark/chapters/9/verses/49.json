{"verse":"49","text":"“Further, everyone will be seasoned with fire,Now what might this mean? Well, those who believe into Him Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire; those who don't, get a different fire. and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.Some 7% of the Greek manuscripts omit the second clause of this verse, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc. But just what might this mean? Well, Romans 12:1 speaks of a ‘living sacrifice’ and in Matthew 5:13 Jesus calls His followers ‘the salt of the earth’. If you present yourself as a living sacrifice to Jesus, He will make you salty."}

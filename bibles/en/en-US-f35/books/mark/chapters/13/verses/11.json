{"verse":"11","text":"Now whenever they lead you away and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand nor premeditate what you will say;In Seminary I was taught that this instruction is for martyrs, not preachers! But churches today would be better off if their pastors got their messages from the Holy Spirit. rather, whatever is given to you in that hour, speak that, because it will not be you doing the speaking, but the Holy Spirit."}

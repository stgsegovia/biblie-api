{"verse":"13","text":"And you will be hated by all for my name's sake,It is already the case in many places that anyone who takes a public stand in defense of biblical values is vituperated by the media—some have gone to prison in what once were ‘Christian’ countries. yet he who endures to the end, he will be saved.We must endure persecution, without denying the Lord—if you deny Him, He will deny you."}

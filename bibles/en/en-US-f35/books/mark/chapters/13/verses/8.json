{"verse":"8","text":"Because nation will be raised against nation,The verb is in the passive voice, so the necessary question is, who does the raising? and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and tumults.In our day we have seen violence and looting in the wake of earthquakes and food shortages. Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit ‘and tumults’ (to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). These things are the beginning of birth pains.The Text has ‘birth pains’, so what is the ‘baby’? I suppose the ‘baby’ is the Messianic Kingdom."}

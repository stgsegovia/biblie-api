{"verse":"27","text":"And then He will send His angels and gather together His elect from the four winds, from earth's extreme point to heaven's extreme point.I have difficulty understanding this statement, if it is to be taken literally. That the elect will be collected from all over the world, no problem, but from all over heaven? However, since resurrected saints will participate in the administration of the Messianic Kingdom (1 Corinthians 6:2, 2 Timothy 2:12, Revelation 5:10, 20:6), perhaps they are included in this statement."}

{"verse":"30","text":"and you (sg) shall love the Lord your (sg) God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’See Deuteronomy 6:4-5. The ‘love’ here cannot be limited to emotion, obviously. We are to love God with our whole being, all we have. But how does that work? Love for God is demonstrated by obedience, so all we do is to be oriented by God's will. This is the first commandment.Just over 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit ‘this is the first commandment’ (to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.)."}

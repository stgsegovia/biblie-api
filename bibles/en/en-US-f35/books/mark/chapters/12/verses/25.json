{"verse":"25","text":"Whenever people rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in the heavens.Jesus does not say that angels do not have gender. Angels are always treated as male, not female—without females there could never be baby angels. That may be why they are evidently fascinated by the female of our species (1 Corinthians 11:10). Because of death, on this planet we must reproduce, or the race will die out. Since there is no death in Heaven, there will be no need to reproduce; it follows that ‘marriage’ and ‘family’ will be irrelevant up there."}

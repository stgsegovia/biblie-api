{"verse":"8","text":"Trembling and bewildered they went out and fled from the tomb; and they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.That is, they said nothing to the guards or anyone else on the way, until Jesus appeared to them (Matthew 28:9-10). After that they weren't afraid any more. [See the final footnote, at 16:20.]"}

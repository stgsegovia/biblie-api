{"verse":"20","text":"And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the message by the accompanying signs. Amen.For well over a hundred years, there has been an ongoing campaign to discredit the last twelve verses of Mark (16:9-20). I wonder where people get the motivation to expend so much time and energy on such an enterprise. Only three known Greek manuscripts omit the verses, and one of them is a falsification at this point [there would be no point in a falsification unless the first hand in fact contained the verses]. For a full discussion of this variant, please see The Identity of the New Testament Text IV, Appendix E."}

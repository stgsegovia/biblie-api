My difficulty with the usual ‘in himself’ and ‘in another’ is that in both cases the preposition is ‘into’ (εις), not ‘in’ (εν).

I would say that the eclectic Greek text that these modern versions generally follow is mistaken at over eighty (80) points in Galatians, of which I mentioned only twelve (mainly the more serious ones).

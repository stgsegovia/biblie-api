{"verse":"28","text":"—there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no ‘male and female’;The Text does not have ‘neither male nor female’; the formula changes, as I have indicated. I suppose the reference is to Genesis 1:27, and the reason for the female in Genesis 2:18. All are saved on the same basis. all of you are one in Christ JesusThe reference is to the spiritual realm, not the physical—a Jew who believes into Jesus does not stop being a physical Jew, a slave who believes into Jesus does not automatically change social status, a male who believes into Jesus does not stop being a physical male, etc. But if we are all “clothed with Christ”, verse 27, we will all look alike, at least from a distance. People looking at us should think they are looking at Him.—"}

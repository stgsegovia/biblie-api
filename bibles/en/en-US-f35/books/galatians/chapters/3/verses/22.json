{"verse":"22","text":"But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin,“Everything”, not ‘everyone’—that is what the Text says. Romans 8:19-22 spells it out—the consequences of Adam's fall extended to and included the creation. How could a perfect world be administered by a fallen man? so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."}

{"verse":"19","text":"For through the law I died to the law in order to live to God.He thought he was serving God before, persecuting the Church in his zeal for the law. But ‘the law’ crucified Christ, and in declaring allegiance to the crucified Christ he died to the law, so that he could really live for God. Galatians 4:4 says that the Son was “born under law”."}

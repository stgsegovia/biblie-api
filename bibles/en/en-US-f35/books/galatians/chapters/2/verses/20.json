{"verse":"20","text":"I have been crucified with Christ, so it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me; what I now live in this body I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself in my place.A tremendous statement, and when we allow it to function in our lives it is an equally tremendous truth! Those who try to live the Christian life in their own strength generally make a poor job of it; when I allow Christ to live His life through me He makes a good job of it (to the extent that I stay out of the way)."}

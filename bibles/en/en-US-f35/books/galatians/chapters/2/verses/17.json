{"verse":"17","text":"But ifWe have here what in Greek grammar is called a ‘condition of fact’—the protasis is presented as being true—so that often ‘if’ should be ‘since’. By using ‘we’, Paul is associating himself with Peter and the others as a sinner (a nice touch), but they are already Christians, so he goes on to reject the notion that Christ could be viewed as an accomplice to their sin. while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves were discovered to be sinners, then is Christ a minister of sin? Of course not!"}

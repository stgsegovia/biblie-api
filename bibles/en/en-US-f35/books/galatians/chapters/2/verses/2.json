{"verse":"2","text":"I went on the basis of a revelation and set before them [the main apostles] the Gospel that I proclaim among the nations/Gentiles.This event is described in more detail in Acts chapter 15, where verse 3 says they were “sent on their way by the church”. Here Paul says he went “on the basis of a revelation”—I suppose he is referring mainly to the content of what he set before the apostles and elders. I gather that Paul and Barnabas had a closed session with James, Peter and John before going to the whole assembly.—Now I did this privately to those with influence, lest somehow I might run, or had run, in vain."}

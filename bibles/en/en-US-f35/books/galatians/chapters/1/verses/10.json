{"verse":"10","text":"Am I just now appealing to men, or to God?Since it is God who applies the curse, he is appealing to God to back him up. I myself do this habitually. Or am I trying to please men? You see, if I were still pleasing men I would not be a slave of Christ.Oops! Come on Paul, you cannot be serious. Do you really mean that pleasing men and being a slave of Christ are mutually exclusive? On the basis of my experience I would have to agree with Paul, with the understanding that fellow slaves are not included in the ‘pleasing men’. (When I am pleasing Christ His other slaves should be pleased as well.)"}

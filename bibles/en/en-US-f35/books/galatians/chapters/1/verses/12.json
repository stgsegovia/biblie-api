{"verse":"12","text":"because I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather it came through a revelation from Christ.I follow what I understand to be the best line of transmission (though in a minority here, 30%) that reads ‘Christ’ without ‘Jesus’. I take it that ‘Christ’ is in the ablative case: ‘from’ rather than ‘of’. Paul is claiming revelation—this is the plain meaning of verses 11-12. Saul of Tarsus got his training in Judaism at the feet of Gamaliel, but his understanding of Christianity came from no such human teacher."}

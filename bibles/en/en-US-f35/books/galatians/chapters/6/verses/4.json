{"verse":"4","text":"Let each one test his own work, and then do his ‘boasting’ only within himself, never to someone else.Again, my rendering is unusual. My difficulty with the usual ‘in himself’ and ‘in another’ is that in both cases the preposition is ‘into’ (εις), not ‘in’ (εν). If someone forms an exaggerated notion about his work (verse 3) and then starts boasting out loud, he will look stupid."}

{"verse":"16","text":"Now as for those who conform to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.According to Greek grammar, the repetition of the preposition ‘upon’ in two phrases joined by ‘and’ makes clear that the objects of the prepositions refer to distinct entities. Hence, “the Israel of God” cannot be a reference to the Church, assuming that “those who conform to this rule” refers to those who are “in Christ Jesus”. I take “the Israel of God” to refer to sincere, devout Israelites."}

{"verse":"13","text":"Rather, you know that I preached the Gospel to you the first time in spite of a physical infirmity.It will be observed that I have rendered “in spite of” a physical infirmity, whereas most versions have “because of”, in accordance with the normal meaning of the grammatical construction here (δια with the accusative is the usual way to express cause). What troubles me is that the normal meaning does not make much sense here; how could an infirmity be the cause of his preaching the Gospel to them? A counter-cause would make better sense, but I am not aware of any way to express it in Greek; the closest thing appears to be καιπερ ‘although’, that occurs all of five times in the NT In spoken English ‘raise’ and ‘raze’ are pronounced the same, but have opposite meanings, and this sort of thing is not rare in language. An ironic inflection reverses the meaning of what is said. I assume that something of the sort has occurred in this verse, and I have given the assumed intent."}

{"verse":"7","text":"Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son,Here Paul switches from plural to singular. and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.Evidently 1½% of the Greek manuscripts, of inferior quality, read “through God” instead of “of God through Christ” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). Romans 8:17 says we are “heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ”."}

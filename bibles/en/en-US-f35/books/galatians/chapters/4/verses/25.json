{"verse":"25","text":"(for this ‘Hagar’ is Mount Sinai in ArabiaI do not know Paul's definition of ‘Arabia’, but what the maps call ‘Mt. Sinai’ probably is not the real one; consider: When Moses fled from Pharaoh he stopped in Midian (Exodus 2:15). Midian lies on the east side of the eastern ‘rabbit-ear’ of the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aqaba), in present day Saudi Arabia. It has never been part of the so-called ‘Sinai Peninsula’. It was at “Horeb, the mountain of God” that Moses saw the ‘burning bush’ (Exodus 3:1), and in verse 12 God tells Moses: “when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain”. Mt. Horeb has always been in Midian. For a complete discussion please see the Appendix: “Where is Mt. Sinai?”. and corresponds to the present day Jerusalem,The Jerusalem of Paul's day was in slavery to Rome. and is in slavery with her children);"}

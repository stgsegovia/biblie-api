{"verse":"3","text":"Similarly, when we were children we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.The only true freedom available in this life is to be a slave of Jesus Christ. In John 8:34 the Lord Jesus said, “whoever commits sin is a slave of sin”, and in verse 36, “if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed”. Sin gives Satan an entrance, and he has various instruments for binding people (see verse 8 below)."}

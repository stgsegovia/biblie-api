The procedure is for eight-day-old babies, not adult men."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"4","text":"You who are ‘being justified’ by law have been alienated from the Christ; you have fallen away from the grace.They have regressed from the covenant of grace to the covenant of law."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"5","text":"For we through the Spirit eagerly wait“Eagerly wait for”—I love it! Those who are trying to be justified by works don't ‘eagerly wait’ for anything; the future accounting is a source of apprehension.

The verb is in the middle voice, hence reflexive; it means to ‘sever’ or ‘amputate’, but can also mean to ‘exclude’. I take it Paul is wishing that they would ‘amputate’ or exclude themselves from the situation—he wants them to go away and leave the Galatian believers in peace!"},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"13","text":"Now you, brothers, have been called to freedom; only do not use that freedom as an opening for the flesh, but slave for one another through love."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"14","text":"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, namely: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”In the context Paul is referring to that part of the law that deals with interacting with other human beings (not the part that deals with interacting with God)."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"15","text":"But if you bite and tear at each other, beware lest you be consumed by one another!"},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"16","text":"I say then: walk in the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"17","text":"Because the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh; they oppose each other; it follows that you may not do the things that you wish."},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"18","text":"However, if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law.What the flesh wants is bad for you; what the Spirit wants is good for you.

This is one of several lists containing both ‘adultery’ and ‘fornication’, side by side, which indicates that they are distinct concepts. fornication, uncleanness,This appears to be a cover term for other misuses of sex; for instance, so-called ‘oral sex’ does not receive specific mention in Scripture, but would be included in ‘uncleanness’. licentiousness,"},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"20","text":"idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, fits of anger, selfish ambition, dissentions, factions,"},{"book":"Galatians","chapter":"5","verse":"21","text":"envyings, murders, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like; about which I am warning you beforehand, as, in fact, I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.Here is a plain statement (see also 1 Cor. 6:9-10 and Rev. 21:8).

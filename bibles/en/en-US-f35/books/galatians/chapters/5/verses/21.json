{"verse":"21","text":"envyings, murders, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like; about which I am warning you beforehand, as, in fact, I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.Here is a plain statement (see also 1 Cor. 6:9-10 and Rev. 21:8). Religious communities that condone or permit such practices are deceiving their constituents; at the Judgment they will get a very nasty surprise. The list refers to what we might call rather obvious forms of sin; there are also the more subtle forms."}

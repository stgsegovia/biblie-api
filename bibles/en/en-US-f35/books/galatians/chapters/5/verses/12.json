{"verse":"12","text":"I do wish that those who are upsetting you would just remove themselves!It will be observed that my rendering of this verse differs significantly from that of the better known versions: they have Paul wishing that they would castrate themselves, or commit suicide! The verb is in the middle voice, hence reflexive; it means to ‘sever’ or ‘amputate’, but can also mean to ‘exclude’. I take it Paul is wishing that they would ‘amputate’ or exclude themselves from the situation—he wants them to go away and leave the Galatian believers in peace!"}

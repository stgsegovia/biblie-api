{"verse":"3","text":"Further, I testify again to every man who gets circumcised that he is obligated to keep the whole law.In the context it is clear that Paul is not decrying physical circumcision, that has an important side benefit—women with circumcised husbands don't get cervical cancer. He is combating the idea of spiritual benefit from the practice, as claimed by the Judaizers, and in particular the ‘necessity’ that they claimed. The procedure is for eight-day-old babies, not adult men."}

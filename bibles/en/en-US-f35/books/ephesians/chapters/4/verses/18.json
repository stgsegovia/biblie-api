{"verse":"18","text":"having been darkened in their understanding, being alienated [as a continuing condition] from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts,This works like a downward spiral: the ignorance feeds the hardening, that in turn increases the ignorance. The consequence is that they can never get out by themselves. Someone must take Christ's power to them to help them out, before they become ‘dead to hope’. “Having been darkened” is passive voice; they are darkened by Satan, directly or indirectly."}

{"verse":"8","text":"That is why He says, “When He ascended into the heights He captured the concentration camp, and distributed gifts to men.”“He captured the concentration camp” does not sound very much like “He led captivity captive”, now does it. The point is that ‘captivity’ refers to people held in captivity, and they are freed. When an invading army takes a concentration camp, the prisoners are set free (usually). We have here a quote from Psalm 68:18, where the second half says, “You have received gifts from men”, just the opposite of “distributed”. What to do? The Targum (a Hebrew commentary) interprets as, “You have given gifts to the children of men”. Upon reflection this would appear to be obvious. When you put tithes and offerings in the offering plate at church, you are giving to God, but does that money literally go to Heaven? No, it is redistributed down here—some goes to the preacher's salary, some to a missionary, some to pay the light bill, etc. God does indeed receive gifts from men, but He does not stash them in Heaven somewhere; they are redistributed down here. When done properly He gets the credit: “He distributed gifts to men.”"}

{"verse":"19","text":"who, having become dead to hope, have abandoned themselves to depravity, greedily indulging in every kind of vileness.What kind of person or being might be “dead to hope”? If someone is dead to hope, is he beyond hope, unrecoverable? And how should society defend itself against those who have “abandoned themselves to depravity”? The consequences of depravity always spill over into the surrounding society, and according to Psalm 5:5-6 the Lord hates such people, and so presumably will not ‘draw’ them (John 6:44). 1 John 5:16-17 teaches that certain sinners are beyond the reach of prayer, they have passed the point of no return. If someone cannot be saved, then he needs to be neutralized (because of the harm he causes to others) —we need to ask God to teach us how to do this."}

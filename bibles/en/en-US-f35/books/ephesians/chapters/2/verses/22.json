{"verse":"22","text":"in whom you also are being built together to become a habitation of God in spirit.There is no article with ‘spirit’; one ‘habitation’ made up of many individuals refers to the spiritual realm, not the physical. (Recall that in John 4:23-24 Jesus explained that the Father wants worship ‘in spirit’.)"}

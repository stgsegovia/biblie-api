{"verse":"6","text":"and raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,This is tremendous! Here we have our authority. Christ is now seated at the Father's right, “far above” (1:21) the enemy and his hosts. This verse affirms that we are there too! So in Christ we also are far above the enemy and his hosts. We should be consciously operating on that basis, but since few churches teach this, most Christians live in spiritual defeat."}

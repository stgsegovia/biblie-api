{"verse":"1","text":"Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus,I take it that Paul is claiming to be Christ's apostle to them, so he is writing with specific apostolic authority. Less than 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality (demonstrably so), omit ‘at Ephesus’ [such is the basis for the nasty footnotes in NIV, NASB, LB, etc.]. that is, the faithful in Christ Jesus:Paul defines what he means by “saints”."}

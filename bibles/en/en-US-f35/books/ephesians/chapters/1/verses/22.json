{"verse":"22","text":"In short, He[F] placed everything under His[S] feet, and appointed Him to be Head over everything in the Church,Would it not be wonderful if the Church recognized that Headship in practice! Where εκκλησια refers to the whole body of Christ, as here, I render ‘Church’; where it refers to a local assembly I render ‘congregation’."}

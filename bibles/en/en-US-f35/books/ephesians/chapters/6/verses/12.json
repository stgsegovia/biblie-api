{"verse":"12","text":"Because, our wrestling matchThe word here is a noun, not a verb, and means precisely ‘wrestling match’. A wrestling match is based on violent physical contact, and the Holy Spirit, through Paul, is advising us that we are in such a match, and the opponents are malignant spirits of all ranks. The ‘doctrine’ to be found in some circles that Christians can't be attacked by demons is totally and dangerously false. is not against flesh and blood,Even though people may indeed act as our enemies, we need to keep in mind that they are only being used by the real enemy. but against the principalities, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, against the malignant spirits in the heavenly realms."}

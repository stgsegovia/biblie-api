{"verse":"19","text":"and 3) to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge—so that you may be fulfilled into all the fullness of God.If it were not for verse 20 below (see note), I would be inclined to think that Paul's prayer was overly ambitious! Does he really expect us to arrive at “all the fullness of God”?! Well, we have the Trinity going for us—the Father is granting, the Spirit is strengthening our inner man and the Son is dwelling in our hearts—an unbeatable combination (if it were not for our lack of commitment). That said, however, I must confess that I do not understand verse 18—what is Paul describing? Whatever it is, all saints are supposed to be able to grasp it, which seems rather improbable. Verse 19 offers another paradox: if the love of Christ surpasses knowledge, how can we know it? Spiritual growth is clearly a process. 2 Peter 1:3 affirms that “His divine power has granted to us all things pertaining to life and godliness.” So whether we get there or not is up to us—those who overcome will get there in Glory, if not before."}

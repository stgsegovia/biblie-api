{"verse":"30","text":"—for we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.Less than 2.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “of His flesh and of His bones” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.—an easy case of ‘similar ending’). Flesh and bones are definitely physical, not spiritual; so what is Paul saying? Perhaps he is emphasizing that “His body” is just as real as a physical body."}

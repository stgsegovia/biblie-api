{"verse":"15","text":"Why did Apis, your bull-god, run away?46:15. This follows the meaning “the strong one,” a synonym for the god Apis, which is also the way the Septuagint translators read the word. Otherwise the translation would be, “Why have your strong men been swept away?” Apis was the bull god worshiped in Egypt, particularly in Memphis. He couldn't stand his ground because the Lord knocked him down."}

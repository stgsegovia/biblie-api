{"verse":"8","text":"Just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel arrived to see me in the guard's courtyard and asked me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin because you have the right of family ownership to redeem it.32:8. In order to keep land ownership in the family, relatives had the right of “first refusal” when another family member was forced to sell their land. See Leviticus 25:25-28. You should buy it for yourself.’” This convinced me that this was a message from the Lord."}

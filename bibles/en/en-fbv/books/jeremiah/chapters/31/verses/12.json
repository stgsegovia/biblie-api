{"verse":"12","text":"They will return and celebrate with happy shouts on Mount Zion; their faces will beam over the Lord's wonderful giftsâ€”the grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the young of their flocks and herds. Their life will be like a well-watered garden; and they won't ever be depressed again."}

{"verse":"3","text":"The archer doesn't need to use his bow; the infantryman doesn't need to put on his armor.51:3. The Hebrew of this line has been interpreted in different ways. It seems most likely that it is saying that the attacking army was able to conquer Babylon without much trouble. Don't spare her young soldiers; set apart her whole army for destruction!51:3. See footnote 50:21 for the meaning of “set apart for destruction.”"}

{"verse":"10","text":"The Lord has encouraged and supported us.51:10. “Encouraged and supported us.” This is often translated as “vindication,” however this frequently has the meaning of being “proved right,” which is not the case here for the Israelites who went into exile because they were not right with God. Come on, let's tell people here in Jerusalem what the Lord has done for us!”"}

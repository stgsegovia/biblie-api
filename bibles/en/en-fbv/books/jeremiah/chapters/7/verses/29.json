{"verse":"29","text":"Cut off your hair and throw it away.7:29. Either as a sign of mourning (which was forbidden in Deuteronomy 14:1, presumably as a pagan practice), or as a sign they had broken their vow to God as if they were a Nazarite (Numbers 6:5). Sing a song of mourning on the bare hills, for the Lord has rejected and abandoned the generation who made him angry.‚Äù"}

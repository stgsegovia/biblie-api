{"verse":"13","text":"Trouble is coming to Jehoiakim22:13. Jehoiakim is not actually mentioned by name until verse 18. because he mistreats others in building his palace, by dealing unfairly with those constructing the upper floors. He makes his own people work for nothingâ€”he doesn't pay them any wages."}

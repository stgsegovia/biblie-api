{"verse":"10","text":"Who can I give this warning to? Who's going to listen to me? Can't you see that they refuse to listen?6:10. “They refuse to listen”: literally, “They have uncircumcised ears.” They can't hear what I'm saying. See how offensive the Lord's message is to them. They don't like it at all."}

{"verse":"16","text":"This is what the Lord says: Go and stand where the roads divide, and look. Find out which are the old paths. Ask, “What's the right way?” Then follow it and you'll be content.6:16. “You'll be content:” literally, “you'll find rest for your souls.” But you refused, saying, “We won't go that way!”"}

{"verse":"7","text":"In just the same way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns nearby that pursued immorality and perverted sex are provided as an example of those that experience the punishment of eternal fire.1:7. Eternal in the sense of consequence, not in duration—as is obvious from the context in that this “eternal” aspect ends with the judgment. The same applies to the “eternal fire” in verse 7 that is exemplified by Sodom and Gomorrah—the effects are eternal, but the towns are not burning now, nor “forever.”"}

{"verse":"23","text":"Save those you can by snatching them out of the fire. Show mercy—but with great care, hating even the “clothing” that is contaminated by sinful human nature.1:23. In other words, while being merciful to the sinner, be very careful about the “sinful clothing” human beings have on them, so as to avoid becoming “infected” yourself."}

{"verse":"5","text":"Answer stupid people following their stupidity, otherwise they'll think they're wise.26:5. While this verse appears to contradict the previous one, there is a play on words here. In the first, “following their stupidity” means “agreeing with it.” In the second, the phrase means “as it deserves.”"}

{"verse":"6","text":"(Rehoboam and Jeroboam were always at war with each other.)15:6. This verse appears to be repeated from 14:30 and does not fit here in the description of Abijam. In the following verse it indicates that Abijam and Jeroboam were also always at war. Perhaps for this reason this verse is omitted from some manuscripts of the Septuagint."}

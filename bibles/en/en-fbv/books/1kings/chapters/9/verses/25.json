{"verse":"25","text":"Three times each year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord, burning incense before the Lord with them, and so fulfilled what was required at the Temple.9:25. “So fulfilled what was required at the Temple.” Some read this as “so he completed building the Temple,” however this has already been stated, and this verse begins by stating that Solomon sacrificed three times a year, clearly regular acts well after the completion of the Temple."}

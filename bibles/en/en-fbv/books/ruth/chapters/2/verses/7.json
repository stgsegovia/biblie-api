{"verse":"7","text":"“She asked me, ‘Please may I have permission to pick up grain behind the reapers.’2:7. The Hebrew adds “among the sheaves,” but this is probably transposed from verse 15. She was given this unusual permission by Boaz only later. So she came, and she's been working here from morning until now, except for a brief rest in the shelter.”"}

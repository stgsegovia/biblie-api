{"verse":"2","text":"His name was Elimelech, and his wife's name Naomi. His sons were called Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites1:2. Ephrathah is thought to be an older name for this particular Bethlehem, or a way of specifically identifying it. The two names occur together in Micah 5:2. from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to the country of Moab and lived there."}

{"verse":"11","text":"The elders and all the people present at the town gate said, â€œYes, we are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah who between them gave birth to the people of Israel. May you become prosperous in Ephrathah, and famous in Bethlehem."}

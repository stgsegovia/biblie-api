{"verse":"17","text":"While the high places were not removed from Israel,15:17. In 14:3 and 14:5 the removal of the high places is recorded. Of course this did not refer to Israel, the northern kingdom, but only the territory over which Asa had authority. Asa was completely devoted to the Lord all his life."}

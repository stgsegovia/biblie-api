{"verse":"8","text":"Jehoshaphat also appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites, priests, and family heads to act as judges regarding the law of Lord and to settle disputes. They were to have their courts in Jerusalem.19:8. Clearly the priests and Levites would have jurisdiction over religious law, while other leaders would be involved in civil disputes. The second mention of Jerusalem in the verse, together with the verses that follow, suggest that they were to operate as a national tribunal, a court of appeal."}

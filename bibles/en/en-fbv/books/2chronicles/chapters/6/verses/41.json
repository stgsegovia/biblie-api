{"verse":"41","text":"‘Come, Lord, and enter your home,6:41. Literally, “resting place,” but with the sense that this is the usual place where someone resides, hence “home.” together with your Ark of power. May your priests wear salvation like clothing; may your faithful people shout for joy in your goodness."}

{"verse":"25","text":"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.9:25. “Horsemen”: or, “horses,” (the word in Hebrew is the same). However, since the number of stalls for the horses has already been given, it is more likely that this refers to horsemen. He kept them in the chariot towns, and also with him in Jerusalem."}

{"verse":"2","text":"His brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.21:2. “Judah,” following some Hebrew manuscripts, the Septuagint, and the Vulgate. Most Hebrew manuscripts have “Israel,” perhaps reflecting the Chronicler's intent that Judah should be seen as being the real inheritor of the title “kingdom of Israel.” Similarly verse 4."}

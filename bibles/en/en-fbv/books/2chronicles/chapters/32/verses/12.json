{"verse":"12","text":"Wasn't it Hezekiah who destroyed the high places and altars of this god and told Judah and Jerusalem,32:12. Some have argued that the Assyrians misunderstood the nature of Hezekiah's religious reforms. However, it may be that the removal of local “shrines,” even those dedicated to the true God, was not appreciated by some since instead of worshiping locally they all had to go to Jerusalem. This may have caused resentment against Hezekiah which the Assyrians are trying to capitalize on. ‘You must worship at this one altar, and offer sacrifices on it alone’?"}

{"verse":"6","text":"So messengers went to all of Israel and Judah carrying letters from the king and his officials and with the king's authorization. They said, â€œChildren of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped the oppression of the kings of Assyria."}

{"verse":"1","text":"Then Hezekiah sent an announcement to everyone in Israel and Judah, and also sent letters to Ephraim and Manasseh,30:1. “Ephraim and Manasseh”: by this time the northern kingdom of Israel no longer existed, having been destroyed and its people taken away as prisoners by the Assyrian king Shalmanesar. By his invitation Hezekiah is appealing for those who are left in the north to “return home.” inviting them to come to the Lord's Temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel."}

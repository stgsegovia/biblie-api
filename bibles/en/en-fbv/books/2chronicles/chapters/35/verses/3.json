{"verse":"3","text":"Josiah told the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the Lord, â€œPlace the holy Ark in the Temple built by Solomon, son of David, king of Israel. It's not necessary for you to carry it around on your shoulders any more. Your responsibility now is to serve the Lord your God and his people Israel."}

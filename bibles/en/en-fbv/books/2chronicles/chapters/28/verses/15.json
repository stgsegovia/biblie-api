{"verse":"15","text":"The men named above got up and took clothes from the plunder to those that had none, gave them sandals to wear, and food and drink, and put olive oil on their wounds. Those who couldn't walk any more they put on donkeys, and took them all to Jericho, the town of palms, to be close to the people of Judah.28:15. “The people of Judah” added for clarity. The Hebrew simply says “their brothers.”"}

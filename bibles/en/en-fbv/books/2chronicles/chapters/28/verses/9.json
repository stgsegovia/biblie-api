{"verse":"9","text":"But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there in Samaria, and he went out to meet the returning army. He told them, â€œIt was because the Lord, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah that he allowed you to defeat them. But you have killed them with such fury that it has upset heaven."}

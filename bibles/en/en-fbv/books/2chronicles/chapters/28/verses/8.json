{"verse":"8","text":"The Israelites captured 200,000 of their “brothers”28:8. “Brothers”: the text does actually say brothers, to make the point that the people of Israel and Judah were related to one another.—women, sons, and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder and brought it to Samaria."}

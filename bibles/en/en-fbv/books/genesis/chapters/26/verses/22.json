{"verse":"22","text":"So they moved on from there and he had another well dug. This time there was no argument so he named the well, “Freedom,”26:22. “Freedom”: literally, “wide/open space,” which is often used in Hebrew as a synonym for freedom, since people are then given room to move around. See for example Job 36:16; Psalms 118:5. saying, “Now the Lord has given us freedom to expand and be successful in this land.”"}

{"verse":"8","text":"Listen, I've got two virgin daughters. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do to them whatever you want, but please don't do anything to these men. It's my responsibility to look after them.”19:8. “It's my responsibility to look after them”: literally, “They have come under the protection of my roof.”"}

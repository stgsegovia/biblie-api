{"verse":"4","text":"The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.10:4. “Dodanim”: the Septuagint takes the spelling to be Rodanim, as does the parallel passage in 1 Chronicles 1:7. Note that the last two names at least are probably those of a group of people rather than a personal name."}

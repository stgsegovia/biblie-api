{"verse":"32","text":"Noah was 500 before he had Shem, Ham, and Japheth.5:32. From the internal evidence in Genesis it appears Japheth was the oldest and Ham the youngest. Usually siblings are listed in birth order in the Old Testament, though for example Moses, despite being younger than Aaron, is listed first. Here it appears that Shem is considered to be more important, and so is listed first."}

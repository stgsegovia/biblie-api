{"verse":"3","text":"God told us, ‘You mustn't eat from that tree, or even touch it, otherwise you'll die.’”3:3. “Otherwise you'll die.” The word used for “otherwise,” can indicate a possibility of something happening, rather than absolute certainty. So the phrase could be translated, “otherwise you might die,” a difference from God's clear prohibition, also claiming that God had said the fruit was not to be touched."}

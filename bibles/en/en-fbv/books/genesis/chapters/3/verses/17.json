{"verse":"17","text":"He told Adam, “Because you did3:17. “Did”: the word is “listened to,” but not in the sense of only hearing something. It means acting on what has been heard, obeying. what your wife told you, and ate fruit from the tree after I ordered you, ‘Don't eat fruit from this tree,’ the ground is now cursed because of you. You will have to work painfully hard to grow food from it throughout your whole life."}

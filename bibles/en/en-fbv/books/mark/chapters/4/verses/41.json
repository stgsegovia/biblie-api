{"verse":"41","text":"They were stunned and terrified.4:41. Although the aspect of fear is usually brought out in translations, the text indicates that they had been frightened previously. Now they were amazed, in awe at what had happened, though no doubt still terrified. They asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”"}

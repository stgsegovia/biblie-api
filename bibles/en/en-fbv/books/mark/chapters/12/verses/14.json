{"verse":"14","text":"They arrived and said, “Teacher, we know you are a truthful person and you don't look for approval, because you don't care about status or position.12:14. Literally, “You have no concern for anyone because you do not look at the face of men.” However, this literal translation could make it seem that Jesus was uncaring and indifferent. Instead you teach God's way in accordance with the truth. So is it right to pay tribute to Caesar or not?"}

{"verse":"43","text":"If your hand leads you to sin, cut it off! It's better to enter eternal life as a cripple than to go with both hands into Gehenna,9:43. The word used here is literally, “Gehenna,” sometimes translated “hell” or “hellfire.” Gehenna was the place outside of Jerusalem where fires were lit to dispose of rubbish by burning. “Hell” is a concept that is derived from Nordic and Anglo-Saxon mythology and does not adequately convey the meaning here. Also verses 45 and 47. See note on Matthew 5:22. into the fire that can't be put out."}

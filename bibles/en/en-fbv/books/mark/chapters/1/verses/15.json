{"verse":"15","text":"“The time predicted has come,” he said. “God's kingdom has arrived!1:15. Even “God's rule has been inaugurated!” The kingdom is not to be seen as a territory in the usual sense, but God's kingship and rule being restored through the coming of Jesus. Note also that the verb tense indicates that the kingdom is not merely close, but that it has arrived in the person of Jesus. This adds urgency to the response of repentance. Repent and believe in the good news.”"}

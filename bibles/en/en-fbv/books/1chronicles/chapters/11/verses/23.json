{"verse":"23","text":"Another time he killed an Egyptian—a huge man who stood seven feet six inches tall.11:23. Literally “five cubits.” The Egyptian had a spear whose shaft was as thick as a weaver's rod. Benaiah attacked him with just a club, but he was able to grab the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear."}

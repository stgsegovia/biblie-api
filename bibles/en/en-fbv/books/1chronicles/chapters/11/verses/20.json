{"verse":"20","text":"Abishai, Joab's brother, was leader of the second Three.11:20. However, Jashobeam has already been mentioned as leader of the Three (11:11), and the killing of 300 by his spear has also been mentioned. Some suggest a confusion of names or alternate spelling, or that this refers to another person altogether as leader not of the Three but the Thirty, or that there was another “Three.” Using his spear, he once killed 300 men, and became famous among the Three."}

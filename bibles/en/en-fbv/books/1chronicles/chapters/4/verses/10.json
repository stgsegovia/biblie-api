{"verse":"10","text":"Jabez begged the God of Israel, “Please bless me and expand my borders!4:10. “Expand my borders”: or, “enlarge my territory.” While this may be seen as simply a request for greater land ownership, it is perhaps better to understand this request that God would expand all that Jabez had, including spiritual aspects. Be with me and keep me safe from harm so I won't have pain.”4:10. “Pain”: part of the prayer is a desire that despite the name his mother gave him that he would not thereby be cursed to suffer pain. And God gave him what he asked for."}

{"verse":"17","text":"David went out to meet them and told them, “If you've come in peace to help me, we can be friends.12:17. “We can be friends”: literally, “my heart will be together with you.” But if you've come to betray me to my enemies, even though I've done no wrong, then may the God of our fathers see what you're doing and condemn you.”"}

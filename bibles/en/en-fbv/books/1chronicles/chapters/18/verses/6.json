{"verse":"6","text":"David placed forces18:6. What David placed is not specified in the Hebrew text. From the text it appears to be army units or garrisons as the Septuagint and Vulgate translations suggest, and is confirmed in the parallel passage in 2 Samuel 8:6. in the Aramean town of Damascus, and also made them subject to him and required them to pay taxes. The Lord gave David victories wherever he went."}

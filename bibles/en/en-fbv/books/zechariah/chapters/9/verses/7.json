{"verse":"7","text":"I will remove the blood-filled meat from their mouths; the unclean food from their jaws.9:7. The Philistines did not follow the Jewish regulations regarding slaughtering animals, particularly in draining the blood from the flesh. Consequently their eating of meat still containing blood made them unclean.  Those who remain will belong to our God—they shall become like a family of Judah—and those from Ekron will become part of my people, just as the Jebusites did."}

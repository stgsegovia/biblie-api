{"verse":"5","text":"You will run away through this mountain valley for it will reach as far as Azal.14:5. If this is a place name its location is unknown. You will run away like people did at the time of the earthquake during the reign of Uzzah, king of Judah. Then the Lord will come, accompanied by all his holy ones."}

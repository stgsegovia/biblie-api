{"verse":"21","text":"Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord Almighty, so that everyone who comes to sacrifice can take them and cook their sacrificial meat in them.14:21. These verses suggest that so many will come to worship the Lord in Jerusalem that every cooking pot will need to be used in the sacrificial system. On that day there will no longer be traders in the Lord's Temple."}

{"verse":"10","text":"The whole land will be transformed into a plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem.14:10. This indicates the whole of the land of Judah. But Jerusalem will be raised up to where it was, and people will live there from the Benjamin Gate to where the old gate was, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.14:10. This would include the whole of the old city of Jerusalem."}

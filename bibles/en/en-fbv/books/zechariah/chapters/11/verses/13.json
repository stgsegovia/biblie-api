{"verse":"13","text":"And the Lord said to me, “Throw the money to the treasury,”11:13. Or “to the potter.” However, since “of the Lord's Temple” is mentioned later in the verse, this seems a more likely scenario. this measly sum they thought I was worth! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury of the Lord's Temple."}

{"verse":"6","text":"But didn't all my instructions and warnings1:6 Literally, “regulations.” that I ordered my servants the prophets to communicate, didn't all that I said happen to your forefathers? So they repented and said, “What the Lord Almighty planned to do to us was what we deserved because of our ways and our actions. He did what he said he would.”"}

{"verse":"7","text":"My love, please tell me where you're taking your flock. Where will you rest them at noon? For why should I have to wear a veil while looking for you1:7. “Looking for you”: implied. among the flocks of your companions?1:7. The idea seems to be that the woman may have to hide herself during her search if she does not know where her love will be. Some have suggested that wearing a veil in such circumstances may have been like prostitutes who wished to keep their identity secret. Others suggest that the woman thinks other men may be attracted to her and she wishes to avoid that. Yet others suggest emending the text from “wear a veil” to “wander.”"}

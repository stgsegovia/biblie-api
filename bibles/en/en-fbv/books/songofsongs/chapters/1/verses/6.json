{"verse":"6","text":"Don't look down on me because I'm black, because the sun has burned me. My brothers were angry with me and made me look after the vineyards, so I couldn't look after my own vineyard.1:6. In other words, the woman could not look after herself. Note also that in literature of the time, “vineyard” was often used as a fertility metaphor."}

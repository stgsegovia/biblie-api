{"verse":"12","text":"Flowers are blooming everywhere; the time when birds sing has come; the call of the turtledove is heard in the countryside.2:12. The turtledove is a summer visitor to Israel. Its soft call “trrr-trrr” gives it its name, and is a sign that spring has come, like the arrival of the cuckoo in northern Europe."}

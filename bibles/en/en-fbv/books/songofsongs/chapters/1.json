Additionally this book is poetry, and therefore translation needs to be more fluid than with prose."},{"book":"Song of Songs","chapter":"1","verse":"2","text":"Kiss me, kiss me with your mouth again and again,1:2. Literally, “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” The repetition of the word “kiss” forms a superlative, just as “song of songs” really means “the best song.” In addition the poem begins in the third person but then immediately switches to the second person.

The verb moves to the first person plural, which could mean the change of speaker (some versions believe this line is spoke by the “friends” of the woman).

The idea seems to be that the woman may have to hide herself during her search if she does not know where her love will be. Some have suggested that wearing a veil in such circumstances may have been like prostitutes who wished to keep their identity secret. Others suggest that the woman thinks other men may be attracted to her and she wishes to avoid that. Yet others suggest emending the text from “wear a veil” to “wander.”"},{"book":"Song of Songs","chapter":"1","verse":"8","text":"If you really don't know, you who are more beautiful than any other woman, then follow the tracks of my flock, and let your goats graze near the shepherd's tents."},{"book":"Song of Songs","chapter":"1","verse":"9","text":"My darling, to me you're like a mare among Pharaoh's horses1:9.

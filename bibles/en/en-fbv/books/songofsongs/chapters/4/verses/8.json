{"verse":"8","text":"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come from Lebanon.4:8. It is thought that Lebanon is used symbolically here (together with the other locations mentioned) as remote and inaccessible. Come down from the peak of Amana, from the peaks of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains where leopards live."}

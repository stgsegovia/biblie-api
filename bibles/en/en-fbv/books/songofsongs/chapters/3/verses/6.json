{"verse":"6","text":"Who is this coming in from the wilderness like a plume of smoke,3:6. The dust thrown up by travelers in a dry wilderness would be the first sign of their approach. However, the emphasis of this verse is certainly on the accompanying scent. like a burning sacrifice scented with myrrh and frankincense, with all kinds of imported perfumed powders?3:6. Some see this speech of the women of Jerusalem as continuing through the next verses."}

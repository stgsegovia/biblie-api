{"verse":"19","text":"He went to speak to those “imprisoned”3:19. Or “imprisoned souls.” There has been much debate over this phrase. The same word used for “souls” should note the same word is used for the eight people in verse 20. Some understand those “imprisoned” as those people at the time of the Flood who were “held captive” by their sinfulness (see Genesis 6:5)."}

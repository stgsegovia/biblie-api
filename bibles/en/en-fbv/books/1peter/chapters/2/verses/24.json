{"verse":"24","text":"He took the consequences of our sins on himself in his body on the cross, so that we could die to sin and live rightly.2:24. “The consequences of our sins”: it is the results of sin that are demonstrated in Jesus' death. Sins are innately non-transferable—they are committed by the sinner and cannot be passed to anyone or anything else, since sins are the specific actions of the individual sinner. “By his wounds you are healed.”2:24. Quoting Isaiah 53:5, explaining that salvation is to do with the healing of our fatal sin-sickness, not some legal readjustment with God, or payment to him."}

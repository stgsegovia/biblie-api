{"verse":"14","text":"This is why the Lord himself is going to give you a sign. Look! The virgin7:14. “Virgin”: or “young woman.” The word used here is inclusive of both meanings. There is however a Hebrew word that exclusively means virgin but it is not used here, so the focus is not on the issue of viriginity. Matthew's reapplication of this prophecy should not blind us to its immediate application in the time of Ahaz. In this connection the rest of the prophecy should not be disregarded which in its immediate historical fulfillment (Isaiah 8) related to Isaiah's wife giving birth to a son. In her case she was not a virgin, since she had already given birth to a son previously. will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and she will call him Immanuel.7:14. Immanuel means “God with us.”"}

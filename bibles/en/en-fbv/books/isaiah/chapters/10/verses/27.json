{"verse":"27","text":"At that time he will remove the burden from your shoulders and the yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because of the anointing with oil.10:27. “Anointing with oil:” literally, “before the oil/fat.” The meaning of this phrase is much debated. Some suggest that this means that Israel has symbolically grown so fat that the yoke no longer fits. Jewish tradition however associates it with the anointing of King Hezekiah, and some Christian writers have pointed to Christ as the Messiah, the “anointed one.”"}

{"verse":"14","text":"I scream like a swift or a songbird,38:14. “Songbird”: some have suggested “thrush,” but the meaning is uncertain. It was certainly meant to reflect a plaintive, sad cry, and therefore the common translation of “crane” is certainly incorrect.  I moan like a dove. My eyes grow dim as I look heavenwards. I'm being attacked, Lord, please come and support me!"}

{"verse":"13","text":"You said to yourself: â€˜I will ascend to heaven. I will raise my throne above the stars of God. I will sit enthroned on the mountain of meeting, the summit of the northern mountain.14:13. This fits with Babylonian mythology in which the gods were thought of as meeting on a mountain north of Babylon."}

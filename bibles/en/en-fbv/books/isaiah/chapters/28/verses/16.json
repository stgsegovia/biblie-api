{"verse":"16","text":"Consequently, listen to what the Lord God says, Look! I'm laying a foundation stone in Jerusalem, a strong, well-tested stone. It's a valuable cornerstone that provides a firm foundation. Anyone who trusts in it won't be shaken loose.28:16. “Shaken loose”: the word used normally means “hurry,” but can also have the meaning “disturbed.”"}

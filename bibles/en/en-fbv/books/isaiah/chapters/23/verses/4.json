{"verse":"4","text":"Feel the shame, Sidon! For the fortress of the sea says,23:4. Tyre was called the daughter of Sidon (Isaiah 23:12), so the words that follow could be Sidon mourning the loss of her “daughter.” Alternatively it could be Tyre, mourning the loss of her children (inhabitants). “I have no children, having never been in labor or given birth. I have not brought up young men or brought up young women.”"}

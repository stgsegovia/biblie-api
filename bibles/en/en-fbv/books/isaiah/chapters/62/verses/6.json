{"verse":"6","text":"I have placed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they won't ever be silent, day or night.62:6. It was the duty of watchmen to regularly give a report by calling out. In this case it could be the prophets who are represented as Jerusalem's watchmen. You who pray to the Lord, don't ever stop and take a rest."}

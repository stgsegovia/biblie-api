{"verse":"3","text":"You will make the nation grow enormously, and will make it extremely happy.9:3. The verbs in this section (9:2-7) are in the past tense, but are translated here in the future tense, since this is an example of the “prophetic perfect” tense in which future actions are considered so definite they are stated as if they had already happened. The people will celebrate before you as people celebrate at harvest-time, as soldiers celebrate when dividing up what has been looted."}

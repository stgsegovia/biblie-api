{"verse":"24","text":"By your servants you have mocked the Lord. You said: â€˜With my many chariots I have ascended to the high mountains, to the farthest peaks of Lebanon. I have chopped down its tallest cedars, the best of its cypress trees. I have reached its most distant heights, its deepest forests."}

{"verse":"13","text":"Even those who are circumcised don't keep the law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they can boast about you and claim you as their followers.6:13. The boast is that they have convinced others to follow their belief in the ongoing importance of the Jewish rite of circumcision (and other Jewish practices, the problem noted throughout Galatians)."}

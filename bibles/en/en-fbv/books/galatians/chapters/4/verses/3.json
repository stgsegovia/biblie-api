{"verse":"3","text":"It's just the same for us. When we were children, we were slaves subject to the basic rules4:3. The word translated “rules” here is subject to wide interpretation. Originally the word referred to the alphabet, then took the meaning of the “ABC's” of life. Paul is comparing the ceremonial law to such letters and symbols, basic instructions useful for existence but having no power to save and heal. The same word is used in verse 9. of the law."}

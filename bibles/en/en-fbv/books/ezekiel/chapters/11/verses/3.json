{"verse":"3","text":"They're saying, ‘Is this the time for us to be building houses? The city is the cooking pot, and we are the meat inside it.’11:3. The meaning of this verse is unclear. Literally it is, “not near to build houses. It (the city) the cooking pot, we the meat.” It may be that the first part is a negative reaction to Jeremiah's advice to build houses for an extended exile in Babylon (Jeremiah 29:5). Alternatively, some interpret the phrase to mean that soon it will be time to build houses in Jerusalem again—in other words the crisis will pass. As for the cooking pot analogy, some believe it may suggest that the people (the “meat”) are safe in Jerusalem (the “pot”). Others see this as an expression of fear, of becoming like meat being boiled in a pot."}

{"verse":"15","text":"“Son of man, your brothers, including your relatives, your fellow exiles, and all the other Israelites, are those the people of Jerusalem were referring to when they said, ‘They are far away from the Lord. This country was given to us and we are to own it.’11:15. It seems that the people of Jerusalem were suggesting that not only were the exiles in Babylon far away from the Lord in terms of distance, but also in their relationship with him. They also seem to be suggesting that the exiles had broken their agreement with God because they were no longer permanently occupying and owning the country of Israel."}

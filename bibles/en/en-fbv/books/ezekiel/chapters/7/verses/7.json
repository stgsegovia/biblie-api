{"verse":"7","text":"You people living in the land, the consequences of your actions have come full circle.7:7. “Full circle”: the meaning of the word used here is uncertain. It seems to have the root meaning of “twist.” It is sometimes translated as “doom,” but this is conjecture based on context. Also found in verse 10. The time has come, the day is near— shouts of panic on the mountains and not shouts of joy."}

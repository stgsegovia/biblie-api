{"verse":"14","text":"So son of man, prophesy and clap your hands.21:14. “Clap your hands”: not applause, but a sign of horror or of anger. It may even be symbolic of the three attacks mentioned in the verse. The sword will attack twice, and then a third time.21:14. These three attacks may well refer to the three invasions of Nebuchadnezzar. It is a sword of death, killing many people by coming at them from every direction."}

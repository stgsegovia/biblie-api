{"verse":"10","text":"This is what the Lord God says: Watch out, because I'm condemning the shepherds, and I will take my sheep back and stop them from looking after the sheep so they won't be able to feed themselves anymore. I will take away my sheep from them, and I won't let them eat the sheep anymore."}

{"verse":"20","text":"Everything that lives on the earth will tremble at my presenceâ€”the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the wild animals, every creature that runs upon the ground, and every human being. The mountains will be torn down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will be knocked to the ground."}

{"verse":"4","text":"The older girl was called Oholah, and her sister Oholibah.23:4. “Oholah” means “her tent,” and is thought to refer to the pagan shrines set up in the northern kingdom. “Oholibah” means “my tent is in her,” which would apply to the Lord's Tent of Meeting in Judah. I married them both and they had sons and daughters. Oholah represents Samaria, and Oholibah represents Jerusalem."}

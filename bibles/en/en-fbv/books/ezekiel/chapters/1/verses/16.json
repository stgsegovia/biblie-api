{"verse":"16","text":"The wheels looked like they were made of topaz,1:16. “Topaz”: a semi-precious stone. The identification of gems in the Bible is uncertain. Other possibilities include beryl, jasper, and chrysolite. (The Septuagint has chrysolite, indicating that the stone was golden-yellow in color.) and all four wheels were the same. In the middle of each wheel was what looked like another wheel set crossways."}

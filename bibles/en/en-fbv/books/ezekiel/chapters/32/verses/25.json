{"verse":"25","text":"A resting place is made ready among those who have been killed for Elam and all its many peopleâ€”their graves surround Elam's grave. They are all heathen and were killed by the sword, though they once terrorized others when they were alive. They are disgraced, along with all others who go down into the grave. They are laid to rest among those who have been killed."}

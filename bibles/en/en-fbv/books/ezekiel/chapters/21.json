(Are we to be happy, saying, ‘The scepter of my son despises every other stick’?) 21:10. The Hebrew of this verse is unclear and capable of several interpretations. It appears to be a reference to Genesis 49:10 that is being quoted to suggest that any threat of enemy invasion is not possible because of God's previous assurances. This appears to be confirmed by another allusion to Genesis 49:10 in verse 27 of this chapter. The mention of a “stick” is a dismissive reference to the scepters or rods of power of other nations."},{"book":"Ezekiel","chapter":"21","verse":"11","text":"The sword is being polished right now, ready to be used.

These three attacks may well refer to the three invasions of Nebuchadnezzar.

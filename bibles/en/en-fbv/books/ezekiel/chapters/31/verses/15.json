{"verse":"15","text":"This is what the Lord God says: On the day it was brought down to Sheol,31:15. “Sheol,” the place of the dead.  I had the deep waters mourn for it; I stopped its rivers flowing; I held back all its waters. I covered Lebanon in darkness, and all the trees in the forest withered."}

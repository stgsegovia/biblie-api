{"verse":"13","text":"You were there in Eden, God's garden. You wore all kinds of precious stones: carnelian, topaz, and amethyst; beryl, onyx, and jasper; lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald.28:13. The identification of precious stones mentioned in Scripture is uncertain. They were placed in gold mountings and settings using skilled craftsmanship, and were made on the day when you were created."}

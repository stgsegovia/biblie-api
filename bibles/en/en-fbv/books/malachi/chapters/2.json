Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife exchanged when you were young.2:14. Some believe that these priests not only divorced their wives but then married foreign women. You were unfaithful to her, your wife and partner joined to you by marriage contract."},{"book":"Malachi","chapter":"2","verse":"15","text":"Did he not make you one, and give some of his Spirit to you? And what does he want? Children of God.2:15. This is one of the most obscure verses in the Old Testament, and consequently there are many very different interpretations. Some take this line to refer to the man and wife become one flesh, as noted in Genesis. Others see the “not one” as the subject of the sentence and so another possible translation would be something like: “No one would have acted like that if he had a remnant of the spirit.” Some have seen the “one” as referring to Abraham as the father of Israel, and the fact that he divorced Hagar may have cited as a precedent by some for their divorces. The response then would be that Abraham was protecting the “children of God” through Isaac. Whatever the case, it seems best to leave some of the ambiguity present, though in the context of discussing marriage relationships it would seem that the original design for marriage in Eden would be a relevant aspect for Malachi to mention. So watch what you do, and don't be unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young."},{"book":"Malachi","chapter":"2","verse":"16","text":"For I hate divorce, says the Lord God of Israel, for it's a violent attack on the wife,2:16. “A violent attack on the wife”: literally, “covers his garment with violence.” says the Lord Almighty.

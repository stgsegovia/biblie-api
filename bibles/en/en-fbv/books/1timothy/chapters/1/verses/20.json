{"verse":"20","text":"Hymenaeus and Alexander are such people, and I have “handed them over to Satan”1:20. The phrase “handed over to Satan” is not explained and could mean being “excommunicated” from the church community, or allowing them to experience the results of their sins. The fact they are supposed to learn something indicates that Paul believed their redemption was still possible. to teach them not to misrepresent God."}

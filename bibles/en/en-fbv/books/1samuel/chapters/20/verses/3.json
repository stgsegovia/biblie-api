{"verse":"3","text":"But David swore an oath again, saying, “Your father knows very well that I'm your friend, and so he's told himself, ‘Jonathan can't find out about this, otherwise he'll be really upset.’ I swear on the life of the Lord, and on your own life, my life is hanging by a thread.”20:3. “My life is hanging by a thread”: literally, “there's just a step between me and death.”"}

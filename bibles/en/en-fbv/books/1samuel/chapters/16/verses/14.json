{"verse":"14","text":"The Spirit of the Lord had left Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.16:14. As in other parts of Scripture, God is sometimes presented as doing something he does not actually prevent. The removal of the Spirit of the Lord left Saul open to control by another spirit. The way the servants react shows that this was a common view of the timeâ€”God is given responsibility for Saul's problems."}

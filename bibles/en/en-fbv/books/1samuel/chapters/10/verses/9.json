{"verse":"9","text":"The moment Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave Saul a different way of thinking,10:9. “Different way of thinking”: literally “turned another heart to him.” Since in Hebrew the heart was where thinking occurred, this relates to the mind. In many ways this corresponds to the Greek concept of a “mind change,” which is the real meaning of conversion. So in a sense Saul could be said to have been “converted” at that point. and all the signs were fulfilled that day."}

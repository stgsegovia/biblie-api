{"verse":"19","text":"“Please listen to me, my lord and king. If the Lord has made you angry with me, then may he be happy to accept an offering. But if it's men that have done it, may they be cursed before the Lord for all this. They've been driving me away from living among God's chosen people, telling me, ‘Go away and worship other gods.’"}

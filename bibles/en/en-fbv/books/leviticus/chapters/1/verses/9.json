{"verse":"9","text":"You shall wash the insides and legs with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a food offering, to be accepted by the Lord.1:9. “Accepted by the Lord”: literally, “smelled a pleasing aroma.” This is a “figurative extension” of this sensory process which means that in the same way we like something, and by extension, accept it, so does God. Also in verses 13 and 17 etc."}

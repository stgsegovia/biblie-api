{"verse":"4","text":"Put your hand on the head of the burnt offering, so it can be accepted on your behalf to make you right.1:4. “Make you right”: or, “make atonement.” The concept is that due to sin, the relationship with God has been fractured. The various rituals described in Leviticus are symbols of how the relationship can be restored, or “made right” in God's eyes. In addition, people and objects (for example, the altar) can also be “made right” in the sense of being purified, so this term is also used in this translation."}

{"verse":"6","text":"Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, â€œDon't leave your hair uncombed, and don't tear your clothes,10:6. In distress or mourning.  otherwise you will die, and the Lord will be angry with everyone. But your relatives and all the other Israelites may mourn for those the Lord killed by fire."}

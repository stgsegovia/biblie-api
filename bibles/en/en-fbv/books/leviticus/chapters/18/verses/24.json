{"verse":"24","text":"A woman must not give herself to an animal to have sex with it. That is something disgusting. Don't pollute yourselves and make yourselves unclean by doing anything like this. That's the reason I'm expelling these nations from the landâ€”they polluted themselves because of all these practices."}

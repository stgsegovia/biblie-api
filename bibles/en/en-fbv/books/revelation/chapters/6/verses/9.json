{"verse":"9","text":"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar those6:9. “Those.” In the original the word means “lives,” often translated as “souls.” However, the Biblical concept of the “soul” references a living person (e.g. Genesis 2:7) and can die (Ezekiel 18:20) and is not the disembodied spirit of Hellenistic thought. Like many aspects in Revelation the fact that these dead martyrs should speak is symbolic rather than literal. who had been killed because of their dedication to the word of God and their faithful witness."}

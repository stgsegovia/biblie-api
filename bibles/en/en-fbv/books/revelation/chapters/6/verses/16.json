However, this human emotion when applied to God can misrepresent what is meant here. The old term “wrath” includes something of the idea of judgment and punishment, but is obsolete. What is clearly happening here is the execution of God's judgment which is right and true, and does not fit with human aspects of anger that include “being mad” or “furious rage.” of the Lamb."}

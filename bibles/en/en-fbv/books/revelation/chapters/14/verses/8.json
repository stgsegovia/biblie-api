{"verse":"8","text":"A second angel followed, calling out, “Babylon the great has collapsed into ruins!14:8. See Isaiah 21:9. She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality that brings God's furious opposition.”14:8. This alludes to Jeremiah 51:7. In view of verse 10 that follows and the Jeremiah allusion is seems appropriate to conclude that it is this “wine of God's furious opposition” that is in view here. Of course human language is being used to describe God so while his intense opposition to sin is clear, words like “fury” and “anger” should not be understood in terms of fallen human nature."}

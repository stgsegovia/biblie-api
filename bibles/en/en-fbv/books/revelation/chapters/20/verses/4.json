{"verse":"4","text":"I saw people sitting on thrones who had been given the responsibility to judge, and those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for sharing the word of God.20:4. Some believe those who are sitting on the thrones are the same as those who have been beheaded. See note under Revelation 6:9 on the word “soul.” They had not worshiped the beast or his image, nor had they received the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."}

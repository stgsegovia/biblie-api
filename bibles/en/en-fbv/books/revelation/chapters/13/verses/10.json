{"verse":"10","text":"Anyone who has to go into captivity will go into captivity; anyone who has to die by the sword will die by the sword.13:10. There are two textual variants here. The text could also say that those who kill with the sword will themselves be killed with the sword, paralleling Matthew 26:52. However, in view of the next verse that encourages the believers to endure persecution, rather than expecting retribution, the text as translated is the one preferred here. See Jeremiah 15:2. This demonstrates the patient endurance and confidence in God of the believers."}

{"verse":"11","text":"The following towns with their associated villages were allocated to Manasseh but lay within the land of Issachar and Asher: Beth-shan, Ibleam, Dor (on the coast), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo.17:11. The Hebrew at the end of the verse is difficult to understand. It says literally “three of the heights.” One solution is that it is a reference to the third named town, Dor, which is now specifically identified as “the one on the coast,” or Naphath-dor. See 12:23."}

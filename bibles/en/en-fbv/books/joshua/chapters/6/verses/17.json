{"verse":"17","text":"The city and everything in it is to be set apart for the Lord and destroyed.6:17. The term used means that it is “set apart,” “consecrated,” or “devoted” to the Lord, which in this instance meant that no one was to benefit from anything in Jericho—all had to be destroyed. This is similar to the idea of the “sacred” and the “holy”—dedicated solely to God. In some ways the “setting apart” of Jericho was similar to a ban—it belonged to God alone. Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent."}

{"verse":"19","text":"But if you think your land is tainted22:19. A possible reason for building an altar might be that the land was viewed as “unclean” and needed to be “purified.” then come over to the land of the Lord where the Tabernacle of the Lord is located and share some of our land with us. Just don't rebel against the Lord, or against us22:19. “Or against us”: or, “or make us rebels too.”, by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God."}

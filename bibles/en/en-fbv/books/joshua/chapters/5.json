What this disgrace was is not explicitly defined. Some link it to slavery in Egypt, but more likely is it related to the Israelites' rebellion at Kadesh (Numbers 14) and God's decision not to allow that generation into the Promised Land. Initially he had threatened to destroy them, but Moses intervened, mentioning how much this would please the Egyptians (Numbers 14:13). The disgrace then would be that the Israelites had failed God by rebelling against him, and God would be perceived by the Egyptians and others as being unable to keep his promise. The act of circumcision (a sign of God's favor) brought the situation full circle back to the Exodus, and now the entrance into the Promised Land. So that place has been called Gilgal to this day."},{"book":"Joshua","chapter":"5","verse":"10","text":"The Israelites camped at Gilgal and celebrated Passover there on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month."},{"book":"Joshua","chapter":"5","verse":"11","text":"From the very next day they began to eat produce from the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain."},{"book":"Joshua","chapter":"5","verse":"12","text":"On the same day when they began eating produce from the land there was no more manna.

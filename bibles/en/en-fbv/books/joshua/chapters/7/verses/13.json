{"verse":"13","text":"Get up, and make sure the people are pure. Tell them, â€˜Make yourselves pure in readiness for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, There are things set apart for me that are hidden among you, Israel. You will not be able to stand against your enemies until you remove all of them."}

{"verse":"11","text":"Israel has sinned and has broken7:11. Literally, “transgressed,” in the sense of going outside of what was promised. The actual word means to pass over, or to cross, and is exactly the same word that Joshua uses when he asks why the Lord brought them across the Jordan. So in a modern language parallel Joshua asks why the Lord bothered to help the Israelites to “cross” the river, and the Lord replies that they have “crossed” (or even “double-crossed”) him. my agreement that I ordered them to keep. They have taken some of the things set apart for me; they have acted dishonestly; they have hidden the stolen items with their own belongings."}

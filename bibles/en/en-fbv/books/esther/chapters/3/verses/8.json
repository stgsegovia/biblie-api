{"verse":"8","text":"Haman went to King Xerxes and said, â€œThere's a particular people living among others in many different places throughout the provinces of your empire who cut themselves off from everybody else. They have their own laws which are different from those of any other people, and what's more, they don't obey the king's laws. So it's not a good idea for Your Majesty to ignore them."}

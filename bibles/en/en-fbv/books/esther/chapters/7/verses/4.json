{"verse":"4","text":"For my people and I have been sold7:4. “Sold”: or, “handed over.” to be destroyed, killed, and annihilated. If we had only been sold as slaves, I would have kept quiet, because our suffering would not have justified disturbing the king.”7:4. Or “although our suffering could not have compensated for what the king lost.”"}

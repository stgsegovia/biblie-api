{"verse":"7","text":"You set him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and placed him over all your creation.2:7. Instead of just referring to humanity, this can also refer to Jesus: “You made him less than the angels for a while, and then you crowned him with glory and honor.” The whole passage can be seen in this dual way, referring to Jesus as the son of man, both representative and Savior of humanity."}

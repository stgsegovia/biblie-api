Much has been written about this concept and the terms used, and “covenant” has often been retained as there does not seem to be an effective way of explaining what is meant here. The covenant concept is extensively developed in chapters 8 and 9. Problems exist with alternative words. The word “contract” can mean the result of bargaining, which is not the case here. Similarly “treaty” or “agreement” when seen in human terms may refer to mutual negotiations. But here the word refers to something that is God's initiative, and certainly is not between equals. Perhaps a better concept is “a promise that is agreed to with corresponding obligations,” but such wording would be even more cumbersome. that is so much better."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"23","text":"There have been many priests because death prevented them from being able to continue;"},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"24","text":"but since Jesus lives forever, his priesthood is permanent."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"25","text":"As a result he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, living always to plead their case on their behalf."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"26","text":"He is exactly the high priest we need: holy and without fault, pure and separate from sinners, and given a place in the highest heavens."},{"book":"Hebrews","chapter":"7","verse":"27","text":"Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people.

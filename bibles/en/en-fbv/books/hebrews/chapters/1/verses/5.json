{"verse":"5","text":"God never said to any angel, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father,” or “I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me.”1:5. Hebrews is full of Old Testament quotations and allusions, some of which are not quoted exactly or are given in summary form. It is therefore difficult at times to identify the exact source or sources. Old Testament quotes that are relatively clear will be identified here. Note that they are taken from the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. The quotations referenced in this verse appear to be: Psalms 2:7, 2 Samuel 7:14, and 1 Chronicles 17:13."}

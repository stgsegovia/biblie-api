{"verse":"8","text":"Even though he was God's Son, Jesus learned through suffering what obedience really means.5:8. The usual translation that Jesus “learned obedience through suffering” could suggest that Jesus was not originally obedient, or that suffering was necessary in order for him to learn—both rather strange ideas to place on Jesus, the pre-existing Son of God. The thought here appears to be that even though Jesus was God's Son, his earthly expereince demonstrated the cost and consequences of obedience. In some ways this parallels Jesus request to have the cup of suffering taken away from him, but then he surrenders his will in obedience to his Father. See Matthew 26:39."}

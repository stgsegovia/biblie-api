{"verse":"10","text":"That generation made me angry3:10. As always, God uses human terms. We should not understand God as being angry as we are, especially when it comes to “losing our temper” and acting in unloving or irrational ways. The same comment applies in 3:11. and so I said, ‘They're always mistaken in what they think, and they don't know me or what I'm doing.’"}

{"verse":"11","text":"So in my frustration I vowed, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’”3:11. “Rest.” This concept is developed more in chapter 4 and is related to the Sabbath, the Promised Land, and God's invitation to come to him. While it is not the easiest of phrases, “entering rest” is perhaps the best translation since it retains the basis which is to be developed later, and includes all the various allusions. The quotation is fromPsalms 95:7-11."}

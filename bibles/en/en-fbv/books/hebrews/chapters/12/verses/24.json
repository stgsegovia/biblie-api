{"verse":"24","text":"You have come to Jesus, who shares with us the new agreed relationship, to the sprinkled blood that means more than that of Abel.12:24. Probably meaning that Jesus shed his blood in a spirit of forgiveness, while in the context of the first murder God references Abel's blood as calling out for vengeance."}

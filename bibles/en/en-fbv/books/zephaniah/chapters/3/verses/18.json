{"verse":"18","text":"I will gather those of you who mourn for the religious festivalsâ€”you will no longer have to bear the disgrace.3:18. This is one interpretation of the Hebrew which is unclear. The meaning is that when in exile the Israelites were not able to celebrate their religious festivals as they wished and this was a cause of disgrace to them."}

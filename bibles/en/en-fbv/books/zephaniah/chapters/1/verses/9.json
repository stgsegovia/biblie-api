{"verse":"9","text":"I will also punish those who jump over the threshold.1:9. The meaning of this is debated. Some think it was a pagan custom (see for example 1 Samuel 5:4-5). Others tie it to the following verse and see it as eagerness to rob the poor.  On that day I will punish those who fill up their masters' houses using violence and deception."}

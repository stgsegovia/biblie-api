{"verse":"12","text":"At that time I will search through Jerusalem with lamps and I will punish those self-satisfied people, who are like wine left on its dregs, who say to themselves, “The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil.”1:12. In other words, they dismiss the Lord because they don't think he cares about them."}

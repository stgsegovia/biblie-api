{"verse":"7","text":"I, Daniel, was the only one to see this vision10:7. This vision, or appearance, is different from Daniel's previous visions, and indeed the form of the Hebrew word is slightly different. Previously the visions have been while dreaming or are clearly happening “inside his head.” This “vision” seems to be one in which there is a real physical manifestation, and the fact that those present experience some “supernatural effect” supports this.—the others with me did not see the vision, but they suddenly felt very frightened and ran away to hide themselves."}

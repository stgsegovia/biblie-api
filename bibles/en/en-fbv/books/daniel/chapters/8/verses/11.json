{"verse":"11","text":"It even tried to make itself as great as the Prince of the heavenly army—it removed the continual service,8:11. “Continual service”: the word here refers to the continuing sanctuary services that were carried out on a daily basis. (The word used here simply says “daily.”) Some translations restrict this to “daily sacrifice” but the daily ministry in the sanctuary involved much more than this. The same term is used in verses 12 and 13, and 11:31. The continual service was initiated in Exodus 29:38. It was expected to be continual (Leviticus 6:13, Numbers 28:1-15). and the place of his sanctuary was destroyed."}

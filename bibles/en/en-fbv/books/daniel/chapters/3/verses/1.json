{"verse":"1","text":"King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made that was sixty cubits tall and six cubits wide.3:1. This corresponds to around 90 feet high by 9 feet wide; however, the numbers in cubits are significant, especially in the Babylonian context. He had it set up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon."}

{"verse":"25","text":"“Look!” he cried out. “How is it that I can see four men, not tied up, walking around in the fire and not being burned? And the fourth one looks like a god!”3:25. “A god.” This expression on the lips of a pagan king surely referred to his own religious beliefs. The actual term is “son of god,” however in Hebrew “son of” often simply refers to the actual person, not the son (see for example 2:25 which in fact refers to the “sons of the captives,” etc.). However, in verse 28 Nebuchadnezzar identifies him as an angel."}

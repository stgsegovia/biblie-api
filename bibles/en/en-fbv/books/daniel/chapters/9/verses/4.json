{"verse":"4","text":"I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed, saying,9:4. Daniel's prayer draws on a number of texts from the Old Testament (Deuteronomy, 1 Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Jeremiah) and so switches between me/our, you/your, and he/his. For consistency here the pronouns are regularized; e.g. all references to God are designated as “you.” “Lord, you are a great and awesome God! You always keep your promises and show your trustworthy love to those who love you and keep your commandments."}

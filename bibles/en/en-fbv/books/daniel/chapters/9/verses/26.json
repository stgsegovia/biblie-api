{"verse":"26","text":"After sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be put to death, and will be brought to nothing.9:26. “Will be brought to nothing”: literally, “there is not for him.” The meaning of this phrase is unclear. A ruler will come to power whose army will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will come like a flood. War and devastation will continue until that period of time is completed."}

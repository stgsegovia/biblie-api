{"verse":"7","text":"The king shouted, “Bring in the enchanters and astrologers and diviners!” He told these wise men of Babylon, “Anyone who can read this writing and explain it to me will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”5:7. “Third highest ruler”: It is believed that Belshazzar was regent for his father Nabonidus, which is why he could only offer third place rather than second place in the kingdom."}

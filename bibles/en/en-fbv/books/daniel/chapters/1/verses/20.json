{"verse":"20","text":"Whatever subject the king asked them about, everything that required wisdom of understanding,1:20. The Hebrew does not say “wisdom and understanding” as most versions translate it. Some argue that “wisdom of understanding” indicates a superlative, in that the highest form of wisdom is indicated. Others suggest that “understanding” qualifies the term “wisdom,” indicating that this wisdom did not include so-called Babylonian “wisdom” of astrology and divination etc. he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom."}

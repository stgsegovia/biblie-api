{"verse":"5","text":"“I can't recall it,”2:5. “I can't recall it.” Some take this phrase to be, “I've firmly decided.” The issue is the word “azda,” which some see as a loan word from Persian. The Septuagint and Vulgate understand it to mean “gone away,” but most modern translations read it as “firm.” If it is taken in the sense understood by the Septuagint and Vulgate, the phrase would literally be, “the matter is gone from me.” The phrase also occurs in verse 8. the king told the astrologers. “If you can't reveal the dream to me, and its meaning, you will be cut into pieces and your houses will be totally destroyed!"}

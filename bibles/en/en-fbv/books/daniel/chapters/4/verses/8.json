{"verse":"8","text":"In the end Daniel came before me and I told him the dream. (He is also called Belteshazzar after my god, and he has the spirit of the holy gods4:8. “Spirit of the holy gods”: or, “spirit of the holy God.” Nebuchadnezzar clearly vacillated in his “god concepts”—one moment identifying the true God as the only one, while at other times referring to a pagan god as “his god.” Also verses 9 and 18; and 5:11 and 5:14. in him.)"}

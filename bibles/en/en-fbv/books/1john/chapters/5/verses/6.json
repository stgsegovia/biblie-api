{"verse":"6","text":"He is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ. He did not only come by water, but by water and blood.5:6. This is often interpreted to mean the water of baptism and the blood meaning his death. The Spirit gives evidence to confirm this, for the Spirit is the truth."}

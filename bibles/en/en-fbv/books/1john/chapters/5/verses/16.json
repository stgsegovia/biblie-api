{"verse":"16","text":"If you see your Christian brother or sister committing a sin that is not a deadly sin,5:16. Deadly sin. Literally, “a sin to death.” you ought to pray and God will grant life to the one who's sinned. (But not for a deadly sin. There's a sin that is deadly, and I'm not saying people should pray about that."}

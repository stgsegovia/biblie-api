{"verse":"1","text":"This is what the Lord says: The people of Moab have repeatedly sinned and so I will not hesitate to punish them, because they desecrated the bones of the king of Edom by burning them, turning them into lime.2:1. Some have thought that they then used this lime to plaster their homes. The main point is that they deliberately desecrated the remains."}

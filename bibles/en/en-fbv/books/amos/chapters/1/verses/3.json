{"verse":"3","text":"This is what the Lord says: The people of Damascus have repeatedly sinned1:3. Literally, “For three sins of Damascus, and for four.” and so I will not hesitate to punish them, for they beat the people of Gilead with sharp iron threshing tools.1:3. The reference is to threshing grain, where wooden boards studded with sharp iron spikes were dragged across the grain on the threshing floor to cut up the stalks and separate out the grain."}

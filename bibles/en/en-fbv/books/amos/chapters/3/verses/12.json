{"verse":"12","text":"This is what the Lord says: Just as a shepherd tries to rescue a sheep from a lion's mouth, but only saves a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, so it will be for the people of Israel living in Samaria—all that will be “saved” will be the corner of a couch and a piece of a leg from a bed.3:12. The point being made here is not how little is saved, but nothing is saved except proof of total destruction. A shepherd took the remains of a sheep to the owner to prove how the animal died; otherwise he would have to pay for it himself. Similarly with Israel, it's destruction would be so complete that the only evidence left would only confirm this."}

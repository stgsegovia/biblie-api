{"verse":"27","text":"Just be sure that the way you live your lives corresponds to the good news of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or not I can get to hear how you're doingâ€”that you stand firm in full agreement with one another, spiritually united as you work together for the trusting faith of the good news."}

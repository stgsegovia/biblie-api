{"verse":"13","text":"Repent in your minds, and not by tearing your clothes.‚Äù2:13. Tearing one's clothes was a sign of intense emotion, grief, and repentance. Come back to the Lord your God for he is gracious and kind. He is slow to get angry and full of faithful love, and changes his mind about sending punishment."}

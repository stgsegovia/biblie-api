{"verse":"14","text":"Huge mobs are in the valley of the Lord's verdict.3:14. The usual translation “in the valley of decision” suggests that these “multitudes” still are making their decision. However, this decision is that of God, and is the execution of that decision—in other words the verdict or sentence.  For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of his verdict."}

{"verse":"5","text":"This is why, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I sent to find out whether you were still trusting in God. I was concerned that the devil3:5. “The devil,” Literally, “the tempter.” had successfully tempted you and that all our work had been for nothing!3:5. “Successfully tempted”—the original is actually just “tempted” but in English this doesn't imply what Paul fears—that the temptation has succeeded. The issue here is not being tempted, but falling into sin as a result of temptation."}

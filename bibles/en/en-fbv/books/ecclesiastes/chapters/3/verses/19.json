{"verse":"19","text":"For what happens to human beings is the same as what happens to animals—in the same way one dies, the other dies too. They all have the breath of life—so regarding any advantage human beings have over animals, there is none. Definitely this is very hard to understand!3:19. In addition, since this follows a discussion of “breath” (that can also be translated “spirit”), this can be linked to the continued theme of “transience” and “difficult to understand” which as mentioned before comes from the word for vapor or breath."}

They have everything they want. But God doesn't let them enjoy what they have. Instead somebody else does! This is hard to fathom, and is truly evil."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"3","text":"A man could have one hundred children, and grow old, but it wouldn't matter how long his life was if he couldn't enjoy it and at the end receive a decent burial. I would say that a stillborn child would be better off than him."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"4","text":"The way a stillborn child comes into the world and then leaves is painfully hard to understand—arriving and departing in darkness—and who he would have been is never known.6:4. Literally, “In darkness his name will be covered.” However, this is more than simply remaining nameless. Name in Hebrew thought is associated with character and personality, so what is being said here is that the stillborn child will never have the chance to become a person."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"5","text":"He never saw the light of day or knew what it was like to live. Yet the child finds rest, and not this man."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"6","text":"Even if this man were to live a thousand years twice over he still wouldn't be happy.

The word is literally “mouth,” so generally “to eat” is understood. However, human work is to supply all kinds of needs, so it is suggested that the application is more general than simply eating., but they're never satisfied."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"8","text":"So then, what real advantage do wise people have over those who are fools?

But this is also hard to do, like running after the wind."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"10","text":"Everything that exists has already been described6:10. “Described”: literally, “named.” However, in Hebrew thought “name” is far more than a simple appellation, it is descriptive of the object or person.. Everyone knows what people are like, and that you can't win an argument with a superior.6:10. “A superior”: literally, “stronger”: this could refer to either physical or mental strength. However, some kind of argument is probably in view, but the point is that a superior does not have to “play by the rules” of argument. Some take the “stronger” one to mean God, in which case the gist of the phrase means “you can't argue with God.” In addition, some have seen in this verse an argument for predestination, but the text does not necessarily support this."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"11","text":"For the more words you use, the harder it is to make sense. So what's the point?"},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"6","verse":"12","text":"Who knows what's best for us and our lives? During our short lives that pass like shadows we have many unanswered questions. And who can tell us what will happen when we're gone?6:12. This could mean what will happen on earth once people die, or what will happen to people after death. Both interpretations are possible from the text."}]}

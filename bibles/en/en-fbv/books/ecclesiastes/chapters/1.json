It's all so hard to understand!” says the Teacher.1:2. The word used here five times! (and frequently repeated in the book) does not really mean “meaningless” as is so often translated. Its basic meaning is “vapor” or “breath,” and is associated with all that is transitory and fleeting. “Transient” or “ephemeral” would also reflect the meaning—it's not that there is no value, but that everything passes so quickly. Nothing lasts! It is the brevity of life that “makes no sense” and causes frustrating uncertainty. The shortness and unsubstantial nature of existence is what the Teacher finds hard to understand. It's “elusive.”"},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"1","verse":"3","text":"What benefit1:3. Here is another word that is used in a special sense in Ecclesiastes. Its primary meaning is “gain” or “profit” in a business sense, but here it is being used more in the sense of “life benefit”—in other words, what advantage is gained in the sense of “the meaning of life” and any future reward? do you get for slaving away in this life?1:3. Literally, “under the sun.”"},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"1","verse":"4","text":"People come, and people go, but the earth lasts forever!"},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"1","verse":"5","text":"The sun comes up, and the sun goes down, and then rushes to its place to rise again."},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"1","verse":"6","text":"The wind blows south, and then turns to the north.

This is why the KJV translates the phrase as “vexation of spirit.”"},{"book":"Ecclesiastes","chapter":"1","verse":"15","text":"You can't straighten what is twisted, and you can't count what isn't there.1:15.

{"verse":"14","text":"I examined everything people do here on earth, and discovered that it's all so temporary—trying to understand it is like trying to pin down the wind!1:14. “Wind.” There is a problem in translation since the same word is used in this book for “wind,” “breath,” or “spirit.” So the proverbial “chasing after the wind” could indeed mean “chasing after breath/spirit,” which could be interpreted as seeking the meaning of life (breath/spirit). This is why the KJV translates the phrase as “vexation of spirit.”"}

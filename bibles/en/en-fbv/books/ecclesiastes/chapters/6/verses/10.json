{"verse":"10","text":"Everything that exists has already been described6:10. “Described”: literally, “named.” However, in Hebrew thought “name” is far more than a simple appellation, it is descriptive of the object or person.. Everyone knows what people are like, and that you can't win an argument with a superior.6:10. “A superior”: literally, “stronger”: this could refer to either physical or mental strength. However, some kind of argument is probably in view, but the point is that a superior does not have to “play by the rules” of argument. Some take the “stronger” one to mean God, in which case the gist of the phrase means “you can't argue with God.” In addition, some have seen in this verse an argument for predestination, but the text does not necessarily support this."}

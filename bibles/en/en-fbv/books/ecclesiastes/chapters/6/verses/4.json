{"verse":"4","text":"The way a stillborn child comes into the world and then leaves is painfully hard to understand—arriving and departing in darkness—and who he would have been is never known.6:4. Literally, “In darkness his name will be covered.” However, this is more than simply remaining nameless. Name in Hebrew thought is associated with character and personality, so what is being said here is that the stillborn child will never have the chance to become a person."}

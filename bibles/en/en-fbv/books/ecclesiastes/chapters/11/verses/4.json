{"verse":"4","text":"The farmer who pays attention to the direction of the wind knows when not to sow, and by watching the clouds knows when not to reap.11:4. These statements reflect the local weather. Farmers did not sow when east winds were blowing, since that was dry wind from the desert. West winds brought rain and were a good time to sow. The opposite was true for harvestâ€”dry weather was called for, not clouds bringing rain. What is being encouraged here is the general theme of wisdom through observation."}

{"verse":"6","text":"Don't let your mouth cause you to sin. And don't tell the priest5:6. Literally, “messenger.” In Malachi 2:7 priests are identified as messengers. In any case, the situation is one of informing someone at the Temple that the promise (vow) you made was a mistake. that your vow was a mistake, for why would you antagonize God by breaking your promise?5:6. Many such promises (vows) included a self-pronounced curse if it was not kept—so by failing to keep the promise, the individual would be subject to the curse they had pronounced on themselves. He could bring your own curse down on you."}

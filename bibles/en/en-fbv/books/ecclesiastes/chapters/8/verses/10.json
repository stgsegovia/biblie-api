{"verse":"10","text":"Yes, I have seen wicked people buried with great honor.8:10. The Hebrew simply says “the wicked were buried,” but since this is unremarkable it is understood that they were buried with much show and ceremony. They used to go to the holy place,8:10. The Hebrew text is unclear. “Holy place” would refer to the Temple or the synagogue. and were praised in the very city where they did their evil. This is hard to understand!"}

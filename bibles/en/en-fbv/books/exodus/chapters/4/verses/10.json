{"verse":"10","text":"Then Moses said to the Lord, “Please excuse me, but I'm not someone who is good with words—not in the past, and not from the time you have been speaking with me, your servant. My speech is slow and I don't say things well.”4:10. “My speech is slow and I don't say things well”: literally, “I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue.”"}

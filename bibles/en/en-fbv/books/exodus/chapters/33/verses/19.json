{"verse":"19","text":"“I will make all the goodness of my character pass in front of you, I will call out the name ‘Yahweh,’33:19. “Yahweh”: this is the word usually translated as “the Lord,” so in the following verses note that “Yahweh” and “the Lord” are the same. I will show grace to those I want to show grace, and I will show mercy to those I want to show mercy."}

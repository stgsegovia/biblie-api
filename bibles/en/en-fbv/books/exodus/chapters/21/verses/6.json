{"verse":"6","text":"then his master is to take him before the judges.21:6. The word used here also can refer to God, but in this context it seems a civil court is what is being referred to. Also in 22:8,9. Then he shall have him stand against the door or doorpost and use a metal tool to make a hole in his ear. Then he shall work for his master for life."}

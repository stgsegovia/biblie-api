{"verse":"23","text":"But Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai. You yourself warned us, ‘Set up a boundary around the mountain, and treat it as holy.’”19:23. “Treat it as holy”: the same word is used as for the people, being spiritually prepared, “consecrated.” Clearly however an inanimate object such as a mountain cannot be “consecrated” in the same way as a person."}

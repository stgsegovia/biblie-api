{"verse":"23","text":"If you follow my advice, and if it's what God tells you to do, then you will be able to survive, and all these people can go home satisfied that their cases have been heard.”18:23. “Satisfied that their cases have been heard”: literally, “in peace.” The word shalom however means more than peace, it also has the meaning of well-being and harmony within the community."}

{"verse":"25","text":"He released the man imprisoned for rebellion and murder, but he sent Jesus to be put to death in accordance with their demands.23:25. Literally, “handed Jesus over to their will.” It does not say that Pilate handed Jesus over to the Jews, since Jesus was executed by the Romans, but that Pilate acceded to their demands for Jesus' death."}

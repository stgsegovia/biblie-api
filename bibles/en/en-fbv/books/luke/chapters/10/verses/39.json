{"verse":"39","text":"She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.10:39. By doing this Mary identified herself as one of Jesus' disciples, and the fact that Jesus allowed this and defended her action shows that he accepted her as such. It may be that Martha's concern was more about this breaking of normal social protocol than for kitchen help, and that her complaint to Jesus was more of an excuse. Jesus' reply indicates that Mary's choice to be his disciple was more important, calling it the right thing that wouldn't be taken away from her."}

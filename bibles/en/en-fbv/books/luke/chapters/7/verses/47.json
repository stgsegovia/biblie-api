{"verse":"47","text":"So I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—that's why she loves so much.7:47. This verse is sometimes understood as if it's the woman's love that brings the great forgiveness. However, the context (especially verse 43) makes it clear that it's the extent of forgiveness that engenders the great love. But whoever is forgiven little, only loves a little.”"}

{"verse":"38","text":"give, and you will be given generously in return. When what you're given is measured out, it's pressed down so more can be added, spilling out over the top, pouring into your lap! For how much you give will determine how much you receive.”6:38. Or “For the way you measure what you give will be used to measure what you receive.”"}

{"verse":"27","text":"At her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay motionless. At her feet he collapsed, he fell; where he collapsed, there he fell, his life plundered from him.5:27. While there is much repetition in this verse, it is retained in translation for its dramatic effect. The last word in the Hebrew text means “plundered” or “looted” is also retained in translation rather than simply saying he was dead, since his life was taken from him in a similar way to a soldier plundering a victim's home."}

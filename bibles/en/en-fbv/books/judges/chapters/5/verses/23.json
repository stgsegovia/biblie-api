{"verse":"23","text":"‘Curse Meroz,’5:23. “Meroz”: the place is not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture. It is thought it may refer to Israelites who had become so “Canaanized” that they refused to help their fellow countrymen. says the angel of the Lord. ‘Totally curse those who live there, for they refused to come help the Lord, to help the Lord against the powerful enemies.’"}

{"verse":"7","text":"The five men left and went to the town of Laish. They observed that the people there lived in safety, and followed the customs of the Sidonians. The people were unsuspecting and confident of their security, at home in a productive land. They didn't have a strong ruler, they lived a long way from the Sidonians, and had no other allies to help them.18:7. “To help them.” Supplied for clarity. The spies would obviously be concerned about who might come to the aid of this town if it was attacked. The distance from Sidon and the lack of apparent alliances gave them encouragement that an attack would be successful. In addition, the lack of a “strong ruler” (literally, “a possessor of restraint”) meant that the town's defense would not be under a powerful military commander."}

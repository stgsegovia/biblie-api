{"verse":"6","text":"“Go in peace,” the priest replied. “The journey you are taking is being observed by the Lord.”18:6. Note that the priest is not declaring success or otherwise. Literally he says that the journey “is in front of the Lord,” which can mean either that the Lord is leading, or that the Lord is scrutinizing their actions. The quick response by the priest also leads to the suspicion that he did not really spend much time asking the Lord for an answer."}

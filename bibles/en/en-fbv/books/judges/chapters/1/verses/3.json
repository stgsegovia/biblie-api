{"verse":"3","text":"The men of Judah said to their relatives of the tribe of Simeon, “Come with us to the land that has been allotted to us, and fight together with us against the Canaanites. Then we'll do the same for you and your allotted land.”1:3. The allocations of land were next to each other. So the tribe of Simeon joined with them."}

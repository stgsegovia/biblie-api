{"verse":"5","text":"She would sit under Deborah's Palm between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for her decisions.4:5. Though Deborah is called a “judge,” her role is far more than that of a magistrate. The decisions she made were of national importance, more than the mere settling of legal disputes. In this case, “judging” would have the meaning of “governing.”"}

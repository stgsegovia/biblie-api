{"verse":"4","text":"“This is the prophecy of Balaam, son of Beor, the prophecy of a man who sees with eyes that are wide open,24:4. “Wide open”: the word only occurs here and in verse 15. It is variously translated as “closed” or “open,” however the meaning is essentially clear in that Balaam is referring to prophetic insight. The Latin Vulgate has “eyes that are blocked” while the Greek Septuagint has “who truly sees.” the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees the vision given by Almighty, who bows down in respect with open eyes."}

{"verse":"17","text":"I see him, but this isn't now. I observe him, but this isn't close at hand. In the future a leader like a star will come from Jacob, a ruler with a scepter will come to power from Israel. He will crush the heads of the Moabites, and destroy all the people of Seth.24:17. “The people of Seth”: if this was taken literally, such a description would also include the Israelites as descendants of Seth. In the context of Hebrew parallel poetry here it probably refers specifically to the Moabites. In the parallel passage in Jeremiah 48:45 it reads “rebellious people.”"}

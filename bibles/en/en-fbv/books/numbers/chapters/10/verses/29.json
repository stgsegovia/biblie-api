{"verse":"29","text":"Moses explained to Hobab, the son of Moses' father-in-law Reuel the Midianite,10:29. This would make Hobab Moses' brother-in-law. “We're leaving for the place of which the Lord promised, ‘I'm going to give it to you.’ Come with us, and we'll be good to you, because the Lord has promised good things to Israel.”"}

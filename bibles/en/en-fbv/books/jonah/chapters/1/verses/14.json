{"verse":"14","text":"Then they called out to the Lord,1:14. The sailors use the same name for God as Jonah did, Yahweh, showing that they believe him to be responsible. “Lord! Please don't kill us for sacrificing this man's life or for spilling innocent blood, for you, Lord, made it happen.”1:14. Or “it pleased you Lord to do this.”"}

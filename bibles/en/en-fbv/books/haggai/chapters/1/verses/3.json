{"verse":"3","text":"Then the Lord sent a message through the prophet Haggai, saying,1:3. The use of quotation marks is avoided once again as it is confusing to open and close them when the Lord refers to himself speaking. It is also at times hard to determine which are the Lord's words and those of the prophet who is speaking for him. See also footnote for Isaiah 1:2."}

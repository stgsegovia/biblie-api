{"verse":"4","text":"All of them are adulterers, burning with lust like an oven whose fire stays hot, even though it is not tended by the baker, having left the dough to rise after kneading.7:4. The image is of a very hot fire that is prepared for baking bread. The rising of the dough is compared to the time of Israel before their end, carried off into captivity. It also seems to be a reference to the king who does nothing to keep the fire of apostasy under control."}

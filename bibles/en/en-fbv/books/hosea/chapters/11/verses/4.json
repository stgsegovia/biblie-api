{"verse":"4","text":"I led them along with cords of kindness, with ropes of love. I was the one who eased their burden and bent down to feed them.11:4. The image shifts to care for a farm animal. The Hebrew literally says, “I became like those who lift up a yoke that was in their jaws.” The burden is not removed altogether, but is made easier to bear."}

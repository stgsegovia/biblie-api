{"verse":"4","text":"For the people of Israel shall be without a king or a prince, without a sacrifice or a stone pillar or a pagan image or an idolatrous shrine3:4. The phrase “a stone pillar or a pagan image or an idolatrous shrine” are all aspects of Israel's adultery in following other gods. Even “king” and “prince” were symbols of Israel's rejection of God as their leader for a long time."}

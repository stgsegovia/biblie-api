It could simply mean that God's judgment is against these leaders; but it could also mean that the power of judgment belongs to them and they have not exercised this authority wisely. because you have been a snare set at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor.5:2. Both Mizpah and Mt. Tabor had particular historical significance for Israel but are now sites of degradation. You dug a deep trap in Shittim,5:2. Shittim was the last place the Israelites camped before crossing the Jordan (Numbers 25). but I will punish you for all these things you have done."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"3","text":"I know Ephraim very well, and Israel cannot hide from me, for now Ephraim is a prostitute and Israel is defiled."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"4","text":"Your actions stop you from coming back to your God for a spirit of prostitution is within you and you do not know the Lord."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"5","text":"Israel's pride speaks against them, right in the face.

The word used here of the children is that they are “foreign”—meaning that they are both illegitimate and also the offspring of “foreign” gods. Now the New Moon will destroy them along with their fields.5:7. Various explanations of this sentence have been given. The observance of New Moon festivals was part of Israelite worship but had become corrupted (see for example Isaiah 1:13), so this could be now taken as a symbol for pagan worship. In addition the northern kingdom under Jeroboam had instituted different festivals which were not ordained of God (see 1 Kings 12:33). The main point is the corrupting influence of pagan beliefs on the genuine worship of the true God."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"8","text":"Blow the horn in Gibeah!

This verse has been linked to the decision of King Menahem of Israel's decision to agree to a huge payment in silver to the Assyrian king as a means of avoiding conflict (see 2 Kings 15:19-20). Others have thought the “human commands” are Jeroboam's institution of calves as images to worship (1 Kings 12). Alternatively the end of this verse could also be translated “determined to follow idolatry.”"},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"12","text":"I am like a maggot to Ephraim, and like something rotten to the people of Judah."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"13","text":"When Ephraim saw how sick they were, and Judah saw how wounded they were, Ephraim turned to the great king of Assyria for help, but he could not heal them or cure their wounds."},{"book":"Hosea","chapter":"5","verse":"14","text":"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a fierce lion to the people of Judah.

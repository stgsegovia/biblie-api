{"verse":"2","text":"Judgment belongs with you5:2. The phrase is literally “for you the judgment” and so is ambiguous. It could simply mean that God's judgment is against these leaders; but it could also mean that the power of judgment belongs to them and they have not exercised this authority wisely. because you have been a snare set at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor.5:2. Both Mizpah and Mt. Tabor had particular historical significance for Israel but are now sites of degradation. You dug a deep trap in Shittim,5:2. Shittim was the last place the Israelites camped before crossing the Jordan (Numbers 25). but I will punish you for all these things you have done."}

{"verse":"7","text":"They have been unfaithful to the Lord and have had children that are not his.5:7. The word used here of the children is that they are “foreign”—meaning that they are both illegitimate and also the offspring of “foreign” gods. Now the New Moon will destroy them along with their fields.5:7. Various explanations of this sentence have been given. The observance of New Moon festivals was part of Israelite worship but had become corrupted (see for example Isaiah 1:13), so this could be now taken as a symbol for pagan worship. In addition the northern kingdom under Jeroboam had instituted different festivals which were not ordained of God (see 1 Kings 12:33). The main point is the corrupting influence of pagan beliefs on the genuine worship of the true God."}

{"verse":"11","text":"If Gilead is idolatrous,12:11. The word used here is the same as in Beth-aven, the parody name for Bethel, signifying the worship of idols who are truly worthless, they are nothing. they will surely come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls. Even their altars are like heaps of rocks in the furrows of the field.12:11. This verse suggests mixed worship that merged idols with the true God. Like rocks in a plowed field, this was barrier to knowing the true God."}

{"verse":"16","text":"Then on that day, says the Lord, you will call me ‘my husband’ and not ‘my Baal.’2:16. “My Baal” would normally be translated as “my lord,” but since the context is that of Israel following pagan religions who called their various gods “Baal” then this is more appropriate here. In addition, God wants the close relationship of being Israel's husband rather than simply her Lord."}

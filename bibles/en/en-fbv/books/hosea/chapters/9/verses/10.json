{"verse":"10","text":"When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert. When I saw your forefathers it was like seeing early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they gave themselves over to that shameful idol, becoming as filthy as the filthy thing they loved.9:10. This refers to the incident in Numbers 25 when the people of Israel were seduced by Moabite women into immoral sexual worship of their god."}

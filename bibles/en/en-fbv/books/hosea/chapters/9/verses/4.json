{"verse":"4","text":"You won't pour out any drink offerings to the Lord. None of your sacrifices will please him. Your sacrifices will be like food eaten by a person in mourning9:4. A person in mourning would have touched a dead body, making them unclean (see Leviticus 21:11, Numbers 19:11 etc.)â€”all who eat will be unclean. You will eat this food yourselves, but it will not enter the house of the Lord."}

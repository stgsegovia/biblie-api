{"verse":"5","text":"What are you going to do on the days of your appointed religious feasts, on the days of the festivals of the Lord?9:5. This may refer specifically to the special day instituted by Jeroboam I (1 Kings 12:32) as a substitute religious observance in the northern shrines, in contrast to the true days given by God that were celebrated in the southern kingdom."}

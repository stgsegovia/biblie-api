{"verse":"1","text":"Israel, don't rejoice! Don't celebrate like other nations! For you have practiced prostitution; you have loved a prostitute's wages on every threshing floor of grain.9:1. The threshing floor where grain was processed after harvest was often the place where fertility gods were worshiped in connection with a good harvest."}

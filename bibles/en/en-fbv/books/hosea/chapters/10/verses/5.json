{"verse":"5","text":"Those who live in Samaria tremble in awe at the calf of Beth-aven.10:5. The real name of the place was Bethel, the house of God, but because of the pagan practices celebrated there the later prophets referred to it as Beth-aven, the house of nothingness (idols). Its people mourn for it in their pagan rituals, while its idolatrous priests celebrate its glory. But it will certainly be taken away from them.10:5. The verbs used in this verse describe the pagan worship of Baal, in which his death is mourned with self-mutilation and then his return is celebrated with orgiastic rites. However, the idol will eventually be taken away by the Assyrians when they invade. It will be brought to Assyria as tribute for the great king."}

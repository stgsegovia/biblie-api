{"verse":"2","text":"The Lord began speaking through Hosea by telling him, “Go and take a wife who is a prostitute and have children born to a prostitute,1:2. Literally “children of prostitution.” There is much debate over this phrase. Some believe this indicates that Gomer had children as a result of her prostitution before marrying Hosea. Others believe this could have happened later as she returned to her former ways (note that only the first child, Jezreel, is clearly identified as being Hosea's). Still others believe that this means any children Hosea had with Gomer would be tainted by her reputation as a prostitute.  because those living in this land have committed terrible prostitution by turning away from the Lord.”"}

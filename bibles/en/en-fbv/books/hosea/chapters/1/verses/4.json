{"verse":"4","text":"The Lord told Hosea, “Call him Jezreel,1:4. Jezreel means “the Lord will sow” (or scatter, since that was the way in which seed was sown). Jezreel was historically a place of much violence and bloodshed. because I am going to punish the house of Jehu for the blood he shed at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel."}

{"verse":"11","text":"In my anger I give you a king, and in my fury I take one.13:11. The verb forms used here are not past tense, so the usual translation referring back to God's provision of King Saul in response to the people's demands is problematic here. Since Hosea is dealing with the present situation of the northern kingdom, one interpretation is that the king God is giving is the king of Assyria, and the one he is taking is the king of Israel. Though in the previous verse God does mention the people's previous demand for a king, he begins that verse with the current question, “Where then is your king?”"}

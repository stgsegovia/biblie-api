{"verse":"22","text":"But I tell you, anyone who is angry with his brother will be condemned as guilty. Whoever calls his brother an idiot has to answer to the council,5:22. Probably the Sanhedrin council. but whoever verbally abuses others is liable to the fire of Gehenna.5:22. “Gehenna” is sometimes translated “hell” or “hellfire.” However, “hell” is a concept that is derived from Nordic and Anglo-Saxon mythology and does not parallel the idea here. Gehenna was the place outside of Jerusalem where fires were lit to dispose of trash by burning. Also in verses 29 and 30."}

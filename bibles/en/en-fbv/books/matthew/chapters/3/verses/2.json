{"verse":"2","text":"“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has arrived!”3:2. “Has arrived.” The verb used here is in the perfect (i.e. past) tense, indicating the event has already happened. The word itself means “to approach,” or in older language, “draw near.” However, if something “has approached” then it “has arrived.” Also in 4:17, 10:7."}

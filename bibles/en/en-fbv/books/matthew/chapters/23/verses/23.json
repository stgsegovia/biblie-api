{"verse":"23","text":"What a disaster is coming on you religious teachers and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay a tithe of mint, aniseed, and cumin, but you neglect the vital aspects of the lawâ€”doing good, showing mercy, exercising trust. Yes, you should pay your tithe, but don't forget these other things."}

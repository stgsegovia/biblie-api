{"verse":"2","text":"When you give to the poor, don't be like the hypocrites6:2. A word taken from the Greek which literally means “play-acting.” who blow their own trumpets to announce what they're doing in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth: they already have their reward."}

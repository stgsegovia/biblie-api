{"verse":"15","text":"They have a hard-hearted attitude, they don't want to listen, and they've closed their eyes. If they didn't they might be able to see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand in their minds. Then they could return to me and I would heal them.â€™13:15. Quoting Isaiah 6:9-10."}

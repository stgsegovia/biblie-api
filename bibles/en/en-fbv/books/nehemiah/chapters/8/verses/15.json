{"verse":"15","text":"They were to make an announcement in all their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go into the hills and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees, to make shelters to live in, as the Law requires.”8:15. This is not a direct Scriptural quotation but a summary of the requirements."}

{"verse":"28","text":"Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I expelled him.13:28. Literally, “I drove him away from me.” This probably means he was exiled. To have married a daughter of Sanballat, one of Nehemiah's most significant enemies, must have been a great insult to Nehemiah."}

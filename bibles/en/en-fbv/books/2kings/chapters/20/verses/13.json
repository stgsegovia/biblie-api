{"verse":"13","text":"Hezekiah welcomed the visitors and showed them everything in his treasuryâ€”all the silver, the gold, the spices, and the expensive oils. He also showed them his armory and all that he had in his storehouses. In fact there wasn't anything in his palace or in the whole of his kingdom that Hezekiah didn't show them."}

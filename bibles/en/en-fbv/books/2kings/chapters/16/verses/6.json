{"verse":"6","text":"This was when Rezin, king of Aram, recovered Elath for Edom.16:6. Aram/Edom. These two words are similar in Hebrew. It seems unlikely that the Arameans would have wished to hold a town so far from their own territory in the land of the Edomites. Some versions replace “Rezin, king of Aram” with “the king of Edom,” but he is not previously mentioned. The conclusion is that it is unsure as to whether Elath was conquered by Arameans or Edomites; however it is sure that the town was lost to the people of Judah and was occupied by Edomites. He expelled the people of Judah, and sent Edomites to Elath, where they still live to this day."}

{"verse":"11","text":"Because of this God sends them a convincing delusion so that they put their trust in the lie.2:11. The lie: in this context surely meaning the fundamental Lie about the nature and character of God told by the Enemy (Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28), who even claims to be God (2:4). In terms of God's “sending” of this delusion, note that in Scripture God is often speaking of causing that which he does not prevent."}

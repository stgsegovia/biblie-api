{"verse":"8","text":"The Most High gave the nations their lands when he divided the human race; he fixed their borders depending on their gods.32:8. “Depending on their gods”: this phrase is unclear. The Masoretic text has “according to the number of the sons of Israel.” Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint have “according to the number of gods.” If the latter is the correct reading, it may mean that each nation was separated and given its borders in relationship to the gods they worshiped."}

{"verse":"5","text":"Speaking on the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain these instructions, saying:1:5. Moses gives three long speeches which make up most of the book. This speech lasts from 1:6 until 4:40. In order to reduce the number of quotes within quotes, this section does not start or end with quote marks. This procedure is repeated for the other speeches."}

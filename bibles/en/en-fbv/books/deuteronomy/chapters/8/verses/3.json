{"verse":"3","text":"He humbled you, and when you were hungry he gave you manna to eat, which nobody, including you and your forefathers, had ever had before. This was in order to make it clear to you that human beings do not live by only eating bread, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."}

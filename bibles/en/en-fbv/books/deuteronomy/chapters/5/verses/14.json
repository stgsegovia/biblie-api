{"verse":"14","text":"but the seventh day is the Sabbath to honor the Lord your God. On this day you must not do any workâ€”not you, not your son or daughter, not your male slave or female slave or your ox or donkey or any of your livestock, and not the foreigner who is staying with you, so that your male slave and female slave can have the same rest as you."}

{"verse":"3","text":"Your people willingly follow you on the day when your power is revealed on the holy mountains, renewed in strength every morning like dew at dawn.110:3. This verse has many problems in translation, particularly at the end. Literally: “from the womb from the dawn to you the dew of our youth.”"}

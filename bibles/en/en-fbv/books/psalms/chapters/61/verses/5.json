{"verse":"5","text":"For you, God, have heard the promises I've made. You have given all those who love your character your special blessing.61:5. Literally, “you have given an inheritance to those who fear your name.” The “inheritance” was originally linked to the possession of the Promised Land, and then expanded to mean all of God's blessings to his people."}

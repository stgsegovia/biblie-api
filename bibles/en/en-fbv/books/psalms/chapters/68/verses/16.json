{"verse":"16","text":"why do you look enviously, mountain with many peaks, at the mountain God chose as his home, where the Lord will live forever?68:16. While this verse is complex, it seems to be suggesting that there were those who questioned the superiority of Mount Zion, and that their own mountains (Mount Bashan) were equally acceptable as places for God to dwell and be worshiped. It's interesting to note that even much later this issue of “which mountain” was brought up by the Samaritan woman to Jesus, since the Samaritans identified Mount Gerizim as their holy mountain."}

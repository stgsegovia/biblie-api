{"verse":"1","text":"I thank you with my whole being; I sing your praises before the heavenly beings.138:1. The word used here is “elohim” which would usually be translated as “gods,” but this seems strange here since the gods worshiped by pagans do not exist. It could be translated “false gods,” but why would the psalmist be singing God's praises before them? The Septuagint translates the words as “angels,” the Syriac has “kings,” and in the Targum it is “judges.” Other versions have “divine beings,” “the powers in heaven,” “the mighty,” etc. Note also the use of this word in Psalms 82:1."}

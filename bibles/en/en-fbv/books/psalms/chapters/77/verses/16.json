{"verse":"16","text":"When the waters saw you, God, when they looked they trembled! Yes, they shook down to the very depths!77:16. The word used here relates to the deep mentioned in Genesis 1:2. The image also recalls the parting of the Red Sea during the Exodus, an allusion confirmed in verse 20."}

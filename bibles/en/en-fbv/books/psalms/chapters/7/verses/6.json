{"verse":"6","text":"Stand up, Lord, in your anger, rise up against the fury of my enemies; wake up, Lord, and bring me justice!7:6. The psalmist is using imagery that is very human to describe God. Telling God to wake up is surely not meant to be taken literally, but a plea for God to act. Similarly the appeal for God's anger to be directed against the fury of his enemies reflects a desire to be vindicated, not a description of the nature of God."}

{"verse":"14","text":"Lord, by your power, save me from people whose only thought is for this world. May they be filled with what you have in store for them, their children too, with left-overs for their grandchildren!17:14. The meaning of this verse is uncertain, even whether it is a blessing or a curse. From the context it is certainly an appeal for God to vindicate the good and punish the bad."}

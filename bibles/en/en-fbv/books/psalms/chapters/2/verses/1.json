{"verse":"1","text":"Why are the nations plotting rebellion?2:1. “Plotting rebellion”: The word is only found here in the OT and is variously translated as “rage,” “uproar,” “assemble,” “consult together.” In the context and with the Hebrew verse parallelism it seems that “conspiring” or “plotting rebellion” best fits here. The peoples devise schemes, but they're pointless."}

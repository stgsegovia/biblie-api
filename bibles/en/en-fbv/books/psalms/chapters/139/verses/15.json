{"verse":"15","text":"My growing body139:15. “My growing body,” literally, “my bones.” was not hidden from you as I was formed in secret, as I was intricately put together “in the depths of the earth.”139:15. “In the depths of the earth”: this may relate to a belief that children were formed in the earth before entering the womb, or it may simply be a metaphor for the womb. In any case the point being made is that God observed the process that is hidden from human eyes."}

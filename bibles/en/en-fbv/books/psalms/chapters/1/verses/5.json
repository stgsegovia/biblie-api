{"verse":"5","text":"For this reason the wicked will not survive the judgment—sinners have no place among those who live right.1:5. “Those who live right”: literally, “the righteous.” However, this term is little used in general non-church language and so in this translation it is replaced with phrases such as “those who live right” or “those who do good/right” etc. This is more than being correct, it means living a life that is morally right."}

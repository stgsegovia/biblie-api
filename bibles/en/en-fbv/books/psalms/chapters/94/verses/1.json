{"verse":"1","text":"The Lord is a God of vengeance! God of vengeance, shine out!94:1. The shining out of God's vengeance is a call for the display of justice and right. Vengeance when it is applied to God should not be taken as a vindictive action of retaliation as human beings do when they exact revenge. It is an establishing of what is right, correcting wrongs, and making sure there is resolution to the problem of evil."}

{"verse":"18","text":"Benaiah, son of Jehoiada was in charge of the Cherethites and Pelethites;8:18. “The Cherethites and Pelethites”: the king's bodyguard. and David's sons were priests.8:18. “David's sons were priests”: clearly not being Levites, David's sons would not be priests in the sense of officiating in religious ceremonies. Some have suggested that as used here, the word means “administrators.” See the parallel passage in 1 Chronicles 18:17."}

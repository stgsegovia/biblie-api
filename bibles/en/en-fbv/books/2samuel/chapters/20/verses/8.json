{"verse":"8","text":"While they were at the large rock in Gibeon, Amasa caught up with them. Joab was dressed for battle. Over his clothes was a belt around his waist with a dagger in its sheath. As he moved forward, it fell out.20:8. The details of what is happening here are not clear. Some think Joab had a concealed dagger which fell out, perhaps just into his tunic. Others think he intentionally dropped his sword so he would appear to be unarmed, but that he had another weapon, a dagger, still in his belt."}

{"verse":"21","text":"Mountains of Gilboa, may no dew or rain fall on you! May you have no fields that produce offerings of grain. For it was there that the shield of the mighty was defiled; Saul's shield, no longer cared for with olive oil.1:21. Saul's shield would be ritually defiled by blood, and would no longer be looked after by regular applications of olive oil."}

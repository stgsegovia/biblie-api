{"verse":"14","text":"The king and everyone with him were tired out when they arrived at the Jordan.16:14. “Jordan.” Not in the Hebrew, but given by some of the Septuagint manuscripts. Since the destination was given in 15:28 as “the fords of the wilderness” this appears reasonable. David rested there."}

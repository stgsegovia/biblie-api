{"verse":"22","text":"But David replied, “What's that got to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah?19:22. David is not only replying to Abishai, but also to Joab, Abishai's brother. Do you want to be my enemies today? Is this a day to execute anybody in Israel? Aren't I certain that today I'm the king of Israel once more?”"}

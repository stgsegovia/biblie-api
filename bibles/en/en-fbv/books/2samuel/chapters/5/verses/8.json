{"verse":"8","text":"At that time he said, “If we are to successfully conquer the Jebusites we'll have to go up the water shaft to attack these ‘lame and blind’ —these people who hate David.” This is why it's said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the house.”5:8. There is debate over the meaning of “house” here. It could refer to ordinary houses, or the king's house (palace). However, the Septuagint has “house of the Lord,” which probably refers to the stipulation in Leviticus 21:17-23."}

{"verse":"27","text":"The king also told Zadok the priest, “You understand the situation, don't you?15:27. “You understand the situation, don't you?” This could be translated as “You see?” or “Aren't you a seer?” The implication is that David is trusting Zadok to let him know what is happening in Jerusalem. Go back to the city safely with your son Ahimaaz, and also Jonathan, son of Abiathar. You and Abiathar take both of your sons back with you."}

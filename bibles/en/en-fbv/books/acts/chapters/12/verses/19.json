{"verse":"19","text":"Herod had a thorough search made for him, but he couldn't be found. After interrogating the guards, Herod ordered that they should be executed.12:19. The Greek actually says, “that they be led away.” However, most commentators understand this to mean “led away to their deaths,” since the punishment for allowing prisoners to escape was execution. Then Herod left Judea and went to stay in Caesarea."}

{"verse":"5","text":"Hand over this man to Satan so his sinful nature may be destroyed and he himself be saved on the day of the Lord.5:5. This is not to suggest that Satan “cooperates” in the salvation process. This “handing over to Satan” is figurative language that is meant to indicate that the one involved is allowed to experience the consequences of his sin so that he may choose to return and be saved."}

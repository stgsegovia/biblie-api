{"verse":"8","text":"So let us celebrate this festival5:8. At the time of the Passover the Jews ate bread made without yeast, and threw out all the yeast from their homes. Paul is using this imagery to say that the yeast of sin needs to be removed just as the symbol of sin (yeast) was removed at the time of the sacrifice of the Passover., not with old yeast or the yeast of evil and wickedness, but with the bread made without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth."}

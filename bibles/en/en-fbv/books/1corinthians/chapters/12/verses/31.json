{"verse":"31","text":"But you should really want to have the most significant gifts.12:31. Having discussed the different spiritual gifts, Paul states that believers should desire the most important ones. Of course which these are would be a matter of much debate. What he really is doing is setting the scene for the next chapter, for without love none of these gifts, even those considered the most significant, are worth anything. So now I will show you a far better way."}

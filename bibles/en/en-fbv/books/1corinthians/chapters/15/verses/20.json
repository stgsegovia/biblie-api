{"verse":"20","text":"But Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits15:20. The word “firstfruits” refers to the first sample of a harvest that was given as an offering to God, also seen as a guarantee of a successful harvest. Christ as the firstfruits therefore means he is both the initial harvest from the dead and the guarantee of their resurrection. of the harvest from those who have died."}

{"verse":"35","text":"If they want to learn they can do so at home, asking their husbands. It is not proper14:35. “Not proper.” By using this term (which also can mean shameful or disgraceful) Paul reveals this is related to the cultural context. for women to speak in church.”14:35. The reason for placing 14:34-35 in quote marks is the understanding that this is the position outlined in the letter from Corinth, and Paul is quoting them before refuting their argument. The fact that just 3 chapters earlier in 11:5 Paul refers to women praying and prophesying indicates that this statement cannot be read as a blanket ban on women speaking in church. From the context it appears possible that women in the church at Corinth were questioning and arguing, being part of the disorder he mentions, and this suggested solution in the letter from the church at Corinth is what Paul is addressing here."}

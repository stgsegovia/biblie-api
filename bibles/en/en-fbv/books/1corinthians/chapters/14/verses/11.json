{"verse":"11","text":"If I don't understand the language, those who speak make no sense to me, and I make no sense to them.14:11. Literally, I am a barbarian to the one who speaks, and the one who speaks is a barbarian to me. The very word “barbarian” comes from the idea that sounds being made make no sense—“baa-baa” etc."}

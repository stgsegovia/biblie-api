This is clearly not the use of normal human language. There is much debate over this phenomenon. Clearly the early church was gifted with the ability to speak and be understood in different human languages as Acts 2 makes clear.

Its practice in Corinth was being abused, and so Paul has to counteract the problem here. are not talking to people, but to God, because nobody can understand them as they speak mysteries in the Spirit."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"14","verse":"3","text":"However, the words of those who speak for God build people up—they provide encouragement and comfort."},{"book":"1 Corinthians","chapter":"14","verse":"4","text":"Those that speak in a tongue only build themselves up, but those who speak God's message build up the church.

The reason for placing 14:34-35 in quote marks is the understanding that this is the position outlined in the letter from Corinth, and Paul is quoting them before refuting their argument. The fact that just 3 chapters earlier in 11:5 Paul refers to women praying and prophesying indicates that this statement cannot be read as a blanket ban on women speaking in church.

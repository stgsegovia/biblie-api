{"verse":"25","text":"Now about “people who are not married,”7:25. Literally, “virgins.” Paul here continues discussing the issues that the Corinthian church has raised. See 7:1. I don't have a specific instruction from the Lord, so let me give you my opinion as someone who by the Lord's mercy is considered trustworthy."}

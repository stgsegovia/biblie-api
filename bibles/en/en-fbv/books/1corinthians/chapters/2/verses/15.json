{"verse":"15","text":"People who are spiritual investigate everything, but are not placed under investigation themselves.2:15. “Investigate/investigation”—the same word is used in the original, and can also mean to examine or to judge. It is also related to the word translated “examined” in verse 14. English does not capture the subtlety of the original."}

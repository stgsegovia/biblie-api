{"verse":"7","text":"So what do we conclude? That the law is sin? Of course not! I wouldn't have known what sin was unless the law defined it. I wouldn't have realized that wanting to have other people's things for myself was wrong without the law that says, “Don't desire for yourself what belongs to someone else.”7:7. Quoting Exodus 20:17 or Deuteronomy 5:21."}

{"verse":"8","text":"What Scripture actually says is: “The message is very close to you—it's what you talk about and what's in your mind.”10:8. These allusions are to Deuteronomy 30:11-14. They were originally applied to the law, and were to indicate that the law was not distant and unapproachable, clearly denying it was difficult to observe. Paul now applies this to the person of Christ, making it clear that this “message of the law” was fulfilled in him. In fact it's this message based on trust that we're presenting."}

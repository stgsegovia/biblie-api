{"verse":"26","text":"This is how all Israel will be saved.11:26. This is not teaching universal salvation, but that at this point the whole of Israel (that is made up of both foreigners and Jews who accept salvation through God's grace) will then be saved. As Scripture says, â€œThe Savior will come from Zion, and he will turn Jacob away from his opposition to God."}

{"verse":"15","text":"After breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”21:15. “These.” This could refer to the objects around them, meaning the fisherman's trade, but is more likely that it refers to the other disciples. It is Peter's love for Jesus which is in question."}

{"verse":"10","text":"Don't mention it in Gath; don't weep at all.1:10. Gath was a Philistine city. The meaning is that this tragic situation should not be shared with Israel's enemies, so that they do not take advantage or gloat. People of Beth-le-aphrah, roll in the dust.1:10. Rolling in the dust was a way of showing extreme grief. In addition, there is a wordplay on the names of the towns mentioned in this section, but some of the meanings have been lost."}

{"verse":"3","text":"The Lord will decide the cases of the nations, he will settle arguments between distant powerful nations. They will hammer their swords and turn them into plow blades, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not fight against each other anymore; they will no longer learn methods of warfare."}

{"verse":"50","text":"but thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of Testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle."}

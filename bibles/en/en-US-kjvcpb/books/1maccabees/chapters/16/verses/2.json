{"verse":"2","text":"Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my fatherâ€™s house, have ever from our youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes."}

{"verse":"30","text":"Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided amongst themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves."}

{"verse":"52","text":"And Laban said, This mound testifieth between me and thee today. And Laban said, This mound testifieth between me and thee today. This mound and pillar are a witness, that I will not pass over this mound to thee; and that thou shalt not pass over this mound and this pillar, to do me evil."}

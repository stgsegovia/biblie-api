{"verse":"7","text":"And He said, (in His Word,) that He would break their strength according to His pleasure. And the Lord said, Man whom I have made will I blot out I from the face of the earth; from man to the beast, to the reptile, and to the fowls of heaven; because it repenteth Me in My Word that I have made them."}

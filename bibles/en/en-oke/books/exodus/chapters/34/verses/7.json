{"verse":"7","text":"Keeping goodness for thousands of generations; Forgiving iniquity and rebellion and guilt; Pardoning them who convert unto His law, but acquitting not them who convert not; Visiting the guilt of fathers upon the children and upon the childrenâ€™s children of the rebellious, upon the third and upon the fourth generation."}

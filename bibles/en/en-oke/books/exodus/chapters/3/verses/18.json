{"verse":"18","text":"And they will be obedient to thee, and thou shalt go, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Mizraim, and say to him, The Lord, the God of the Jehudaee, hath called us; and now let us go, as (for) a journey of three days into the desert, that we may sacrifice before the Lord our God."}

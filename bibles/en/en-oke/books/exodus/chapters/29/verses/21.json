{"verse":"21","text":"And thou shalt take of the blood which is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and drop it on Aharon and on his vestments, and on his sons, and on the vestments of his sons with him, and he shall be consecrated, he and his vestments, and his sons, and the vestments of his sons with him."}

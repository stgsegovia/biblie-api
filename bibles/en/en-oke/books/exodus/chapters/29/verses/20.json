{"verse":"20","text":"And thou shalt kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it on the tip of Aharonâ€™s ear, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the toe of their right foot; and thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about."}

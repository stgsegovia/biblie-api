{"verse":"19","text":"And the Lord spake to Mosheh, Say to Aharon, Take thy rod, and lift up thy hand over the waters of the Mizraee, upon their rivers, upon their canals, and upon their lakes, and upon all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood in all the land of Mizraim, and in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone."}

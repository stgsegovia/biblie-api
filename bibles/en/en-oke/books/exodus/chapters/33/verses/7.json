{"verse":"7","text":"Arid Mosheh took a tabernacle, and spread it for himself without the camp, at a distance from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the House of Instruction: and it was that everyone who sought instruction from before the Lord, went forth to the tabernacle of the house of instruction without the camp."}

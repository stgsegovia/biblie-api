{"verse":"1","text":"But the people saw that Mosheh delayed to come down from the Mount; and the people gathered together unto Aharon, and said to him, Arise, make us gods (dachalan, pl. objects to be venerated) that may proceed before us; for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mizraim, we know not what hath been to him."}

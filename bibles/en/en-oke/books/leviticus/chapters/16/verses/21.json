{"verse":"21","text":"And Aharon shall lay his two hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their rebellions, and all their sins, and put them upon the head of the goat, and send him away, by the hand of an appointed man, to go into the desert."}

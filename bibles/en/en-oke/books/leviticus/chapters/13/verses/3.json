{"verse":"3","text":"And the priest shall see the plague in the skin of the flesh, and if the hair in the affected spot be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall inspect him and make (pronounce) him to be unclean."}

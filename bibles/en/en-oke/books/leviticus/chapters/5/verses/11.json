{"verse":"11","text":"But if (neither) two turtle doves nor a pair of young pigeons pertain to him, he shall bring, as his oblation for the sin that he hath sinned, the tenth of three sein of flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering."}

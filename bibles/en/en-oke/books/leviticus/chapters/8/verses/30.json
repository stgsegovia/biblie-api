{"verse":"30","text":"And Mosheh took of the oil of consecration, and of the blood that was upon the altar, and sprinkled upon Aharon, upon his vestments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ vestments with him, and sanctified Aharon and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him."}

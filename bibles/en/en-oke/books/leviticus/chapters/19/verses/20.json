{"verse":"20","text":"And if a man lie carnally with a woman, and she be a handmaid betrothed unto (another) man, and with redemption of money not redeemed, nor having freedom given to her by an instrument of writing, the stripe shall be upon her; they shall not be put to death, for she was not free."}

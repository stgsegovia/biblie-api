{"verse":"7","text":"And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord in the tabernacle of ordinance, and all the (remaining) blood of the bullock he shall pour out at the foundation of the altar of burnt sacrifice which is at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance."}

{"verse":"17","text":"And a man who shall take his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness, it is an ignominy and they shall be destroyed before the eyes of the children of their people: he hath uncovered the nakedness of his sister, he shall receive (the punishment of) his guilt."}

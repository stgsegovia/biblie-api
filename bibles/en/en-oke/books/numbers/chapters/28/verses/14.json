{"verse":"14","text":"And their libations a half hina of wine shall be for the bullock, and the third of a hina for the ram, and a quarter of a hina for a lamb: this is the burnt offering for the beginning of the month, at its renewal; so shall it be for all the beginnings of the months of the year."}

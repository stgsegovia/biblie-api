{"verse":"15","text":"Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and bring her offering for her, a tenth part of three seins of barley flour; he shall pour no oil thereon, nor put frankincense upon it, because it is a mincha of jealousy, a mincha of remembrance, bringing sins to remembrance."}

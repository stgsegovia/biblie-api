{"verse":"27","text":"And when he hath made her drink the water, it shall be that if she hath been defiled and hath wrought perverseness with her husband, the waters of the execration will enter into her with bitterness, and her bowels will swell, and her thigh become corrupt: and the woman shall be for an execration among her people."}

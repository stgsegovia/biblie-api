{"verse":"3","text":"But if they become wives to any of the sons of the (other) tribes of the Beni Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and added to the inheritance of the tribe which will have become theirs, and be (thus) diminished from the portion of our inheritance."}

{"verse":"13","text":"Whoever toucheth the dead body of a man who hath died, and sprinkleth not with it, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that man shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling is not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean, (for) his uncleanness is yet upon him."}

{"verse":"14","text":"And they will tell unto the inhabitants of this land; for they have heard that Thou, O Lord, dost dwell in Thy Shekinah among this people, whose eyes behold the glorious Shekinah of the Lord, and that Thy Cloud overshadoweth them, and that in the pillar of the Cloud Thou conductest them in the day, and in the pillar of Fire by night."}

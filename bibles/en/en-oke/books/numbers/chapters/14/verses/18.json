{"verse":"18","text":"The Lord is far from anger, and great in performing goodness and truth: forgiving iniquity and rebellion and sins, pardoning them who return unto His law: but acquitting not them who will not, turn, (but) visiting the sins of the fathers upon the rebellious children unto the third and unto the fourth generation."}

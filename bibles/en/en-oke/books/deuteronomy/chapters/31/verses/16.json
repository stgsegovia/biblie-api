{"verse":"16","text":"And the Lord said to Mosheh, Behold, thou art to sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up and go astray after the idols of the peoples of the land among whom they are going, and will forsake My fear, and remove (or change) from My covenant which I have made with them."}

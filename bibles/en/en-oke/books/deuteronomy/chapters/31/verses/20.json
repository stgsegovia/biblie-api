{"verse":"20","text":"For when they will have entered into the land which I promised to their fathers, (a land) producing milk and honey, and they have eaten and been satisfied, and have become luxurious, they will turn away after the idols of the nations, and serve them, and provoke to anger before Me, and change from My covenant."}

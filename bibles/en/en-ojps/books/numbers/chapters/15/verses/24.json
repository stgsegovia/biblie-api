{"verse":"24","text":"then it shall be, if it be done in error by the congregation, it being hid from their eyes, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD — with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance — and one he-goat for a sin-offering."}

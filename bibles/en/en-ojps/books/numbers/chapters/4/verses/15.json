{"verse":"15","text":"And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the holy furniture, and all the holy vessels, as the camp is to set forward â€” after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting."}

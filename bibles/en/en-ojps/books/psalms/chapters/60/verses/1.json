{"verse":"1","text":"(60-1) For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach; (60-2) when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. (60-3) O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; O restore us."}

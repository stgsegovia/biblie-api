{"verse":"9","text":"And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him — now he was hiding in Samaria — and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said: 'He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.' And there was none of the house of Ahaziah that had power to hold the kingdom."}

{"verse":"4","text":"5:4 Many ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part, waiting for the moving of the water: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden."}

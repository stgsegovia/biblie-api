{"verse":"7","text":"Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my fatherâ€™s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence."}

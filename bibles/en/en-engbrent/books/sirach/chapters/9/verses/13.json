{"verse":"13","text":"Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill: so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city."}

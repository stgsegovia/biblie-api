{"verse":"24q","text":"And Roboam said to the people, Wait three days, and I will return you an answer: and Roboam said, Bring in to me the elders, and I will take counsel with them what I shall answer to the people on the third day. So Roboam spoke in their ears, as the people sent to him to say: and the elders of the people said, Thus the people have spoken to thee."}

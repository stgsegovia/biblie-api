{"verse":"14","text":"And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Ader the Idumæan, and Esrom son of Eliadaë who dwelt in Raama, and Adadezer king of Suba his master; (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damasec,) and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Ader the Idumæan was of the seed royal in Idumæa."}

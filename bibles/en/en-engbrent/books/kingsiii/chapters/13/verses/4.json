{"verse":"4","text":"And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in BÃ¦thel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself."}

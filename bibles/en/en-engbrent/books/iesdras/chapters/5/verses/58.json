{"verse":"58","text":"And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and brethren, and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of Emadabun, with the sons of Joda the son of Eliadud, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business, labouring to advance the works in the house of the Lord. So the builders built the temple of the Lord."}

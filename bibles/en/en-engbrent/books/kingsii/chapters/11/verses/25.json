{"verse":"25","text":"And David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in thine eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen thine array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen 11. 25 There can be little doubt that αὐτὸν the Alex. reading, is correct, instead of αὐτήν.him."}

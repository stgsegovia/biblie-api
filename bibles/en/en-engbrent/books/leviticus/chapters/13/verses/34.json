{"verse":"34","text":"And the priest shall see the scurf on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scurf is not spread in the skin after the man's being shaved, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow beneath the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his garments, and be clean."}

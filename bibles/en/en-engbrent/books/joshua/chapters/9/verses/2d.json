{"verse":"2d","text":"And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount GÃ¦bal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people."}

{"verse":"10","text":"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and compassion: and 12. 10 John 19. 37. they shall look upon me, because they have mocked me, and they shall make lamentation for him, as for a beloved friend, and they shall grieve intensely, as for a first-born son."}

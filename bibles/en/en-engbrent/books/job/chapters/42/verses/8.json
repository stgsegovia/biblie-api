{"verse":"8","text":"Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he shall offer a burnt-offering for you. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will only accept him: for but for his sake, I would have destroyed you, for ye have not spoken the truth against my servant Job."}

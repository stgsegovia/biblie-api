{"verse":"25","text":"And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole-burnt-offering, that Ju said to the footmen and the officers, Go ye in and slay them; let not a man of them escape. So they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast the bodies forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal."}

{"verse":"10","text":"But a remnant shall be left behind, and their relations shall take them, and shall strenuously endeavour to carry forth their bones from the house: and one shall say to the heads of the house, Is there yet any one else with thee? And he shall say, No one else. And the other shall say, Be silent, that thou name not the name of the Lord."}

{"verse":"14","text":"And afterward he built a wall without the city of David, from the southwest southward in the valleys and at the entrance through the fish-gate, as men go out by the gate round about, even as far as Opel; and he raised it much, and set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Juda."}

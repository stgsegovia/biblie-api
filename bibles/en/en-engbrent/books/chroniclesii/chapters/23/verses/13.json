{"verse":"13","text":"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood in his place, and the princes and trumpets were at the entrance, and the princes were round the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded the trumpets, and there were the singers singing with instruments, and singing hymns of praise. And Gotholia rent her robe, and cried, Ye surely are plotting against me."}

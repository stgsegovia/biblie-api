{"verse":"9","text":"Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and bread-corn; and thou shalt cast them into one earthen vessel, and shalt make them into loaves for thyself; and thou shalt eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the days during which thou sleepest on thy side."}

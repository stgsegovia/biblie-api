{"verse":"19","text":"And thou shalt say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem on the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all that dwell in it are ungodly."}

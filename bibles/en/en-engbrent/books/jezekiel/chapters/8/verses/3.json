{"verse":"3","text":"And he stretched forth the likeness of a hand, and took me up by the crown of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and sky, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, to the porch of the gate that looks to the north, where was the pillar of the Purchaser."}

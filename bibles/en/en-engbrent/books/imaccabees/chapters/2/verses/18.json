{"verse":"18","text":"now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the nations have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards."}

{"verse":"1","text":"To him that excelleth upon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of David to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, and against Aram Zobah, when Joab returned and slew twelve thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs."}

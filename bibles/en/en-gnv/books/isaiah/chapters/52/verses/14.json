{"verse":"14","text":"As many were astonied at thee (his visage was so deformed of men, and his forme of the sonnes of men) so shall hee sprinkle many nations: the Kings shall shut their mouthes at him: for that which had not bene tolde them, shall they see, and that which they had not heard, shall they vnderstande."}
